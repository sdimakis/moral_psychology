# Darwin's theory of evolution 

.footnote[Darwin (1859)]

.left-column-big[- Darwin proposed that organisms evolve primarily through *natural selection*
  - Organisms in a given population naturally vary on traits (e.g., height)
  - When a particular trait is adaptive (e.g., being tall), individuals with the adaptive form of the trait are more likely to survive and reproduce
  - Thus adaptive traits are more likely to be passed on to subsequent generations]

# Morality

- Altruistic behavior has puzzled evolutionary biologists and psychologists because it seemingly conflicts with evolutionary theory

-  Why do some sacrifice their lives to save another life, or sacrifice their time and earnings to help those who are suffering, when these actions can reduce their chances of surviving and reproducing?

# A veneer theory of human morality

- Humans are inherently selfish and amoral beings
- For each person, underneath a thin "veneer" of morality lies an amoral, egoistic animal
- This theory implies that humans are the only moral animals; acting moral requires self-regulation and self-control

# Are other animals amoral?

# Bonobos and chimpanzeess

.small-picture-writing[
- Both live in Sub-Saharan Africa, separated by the Congo river
- North of the Congo river, there is less rainfall and more competition for food
- These different environmental pressures led to large differences in behavior between the two species]

.small-picture[![](images/Bonobo_vs_chimp.png)
Red is where bonobos live, blue is where chimps live]

???
For example, some gorillas and chimps live in the same areas, where gorillas  eat what is on the ground, so chimps have to find food elsewhere

# Is there enough evidence to support the veneer theory?

- While bonobos are relatively peaceful, chimps can be very violent
- Bonobo females ban together to form strong alliances, but chimpanzee males often hurt females and children for their own benefit
- .highlight[Discussion question:] can understanding the behavior of our closest relatives (chimps and bonobos) tell us anything about human morality? Are we chimps with self-control (as veneer theory would suggest), or is something else going on?

# The Beethoven error
- Beethoven was incredibly disorganized and messy; nonetheless, surrounded by chaos, he created beautiful works of art
- It would be an error to say that beauty cannot result from a disorderly, chaotic process
- In the same way, while natural selection can be cruel and ruthless, it would be an error to say that it can only result in cruel and ruthless creatures


.footnote[Frans de Waal (2006)]

# A naturalistic theory of human morality
- Natural selection favors organisms with adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce and lying, cheating, and harming others is not the only way to survive and reproduce
- For social animals (animals that live in groups) like humans, moral intuitions about harm, fairness, loyalty, etc. allow us to peacefully cooperate with members of our group
- Thus all social animals should have, to some extent, evolved moral intuitions

# A naturalistic theory of human morality

- If we evolved an intuitive moral sense (i.e., a conscious) from living in social groups, then other social animals should also show signs of moral intuitions
- For example, if non-human social animals have moral intuitions, then they will avoid harming and try to help when someone is suffering

# Do animals help other animals?

.footnote[Rice & Gainer (1962)]

- Researchers suspended one rat by a harness
