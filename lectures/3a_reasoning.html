# Moral reasoning
## Week 3 - Moral Psychology

---


# Week 3
This week we will be discussing we reason through moral dilemmas and judge behaviors as right or wrong

.highlight-blue[In week 3:]
- **How do we determine which course of action is right in a moral dilemma?**
- **What moral principles do we typically use to justify our moral judgments?** 
- Do moral judgments arise from a deliberate, conscious process, or an automatic, unconscious one?

---
# The rationalist model
.footnote[Haidt (2001)]
![](images/rationalist_model.JPG)

- Conscious reasoning determines moral judgments

- Emotions (e.g., sympathy, disgust, anger) are sometimes used as input to guide conscious reasoning

???
In this model, a person is completely rational. In order to make a judgment, individuals reflect and reason through the evidence carefully, thinking about whether the action is fair, whether it harmed anyone, etc. 

---
# Moral reasoning
Psychologists study moral reasoning primarily through moral dilemmas
- A **moral dilemma** is a moral situation where an individual has to choose between two conflicting moral principles

--

For example, the following scenario pits two moral principles against each other: do not kill and do not allow someone to suffer

&gt;A doctor must decide whether to kill a dying patient who is asking for an end to her suffering. 

The most studied dilemma in moral psychology is .highlight-blue[the trolley dilemma]

???
 By changing small pieces of information, we can better understand how we make moral decisions

# The trolley problem
.footnote[Hauser et al. (2008)]

- Studies have found that about 90% of people say they would pull the lever in the first scenario but only 10% say they would push the man in the second scenario

- The normative philosophical theory *utilitarianism* says that what we ought to do is what will benefit the most people, and pushing the man off the bridge is what is best for the most number of people

# The trolley problem
.footnote[Greene et al. (2009)]


There are many differences between pulling a switch to save five people and throwing someone off a bridge to save five people

  - **Physical contact**: you do not need to touch the victim (switch) vs. you do need to touch the victim (bridge)

  - **Personal force**: you do not need to apply personal force to the victim (switch) vs. you do need to apply personal force to the victim (bridge)
  
---
# The trolley problem
.footnote[Greene et al. (2009)]


There are many differences between pulling a switch to save five people and throwing someone off a bridge to save five people

  - **Spacial proximity**: you are far away from the victim (switch) vs. you are close to the victim (bridge)
  
  - **Intention**: harm is a foreseeable but unintended side effect of achieving the greater good (switch) vs. harm is a means to a greater good (bridge)

---
# The trolley problem
.footnote[Greene et al. (2009)]
**Research question**: Why do people refuse to push the man off the bridge? 

**Method:** Researchers gave participants four different variations of the trolley dilemma

  - The standard footbridge&lt;br&gt;
  - Footbridge pole&lt;br&gt;
  - Footbridge switch&lt;br&gt;
  - Remote footbridge

You can compare pairs of moral acceptability ratings to determine if personal force, spatial proximity, or physical contact are important factors
Personal force: compare footbridge poll and footbridge switch
Spatial proximity: compare footbridge switch and remote footbridge
Physical contact: compare standard footbridge and footbridge poll

#The trolley problem
.footnote[Greene et al. (2009)]
#### Results 
.right-column-med[![](images/greene2009.JPG)]


- **Personal force** was rated as less morally acceptable than no personal force, regardless of physical contact/ spatial proximity

- Pushing the man off the bridge with your hands or with a pole was considered *less morally acceptable* than doing so with a switch and trap door
???

- Participants rated the extent to which choosing to harm the one person to save the five was "morally acceptable"


Individuals judged actions that required personal force (pushing off the bridge with hands or a pole) as less morally acceptable than actions that did not require personal force (the switch cases), regardless of if Joe touched the victim (physical contact) and regardless of if the individual was close or not (spatial proximity)

# The trolley problem

#### Discussion 
- Individuals find harmful actions the least morally acceptable when

  - A person uses personal force (e.g., harms them directly with their hands or an object) AND
  
  - A person uses someone as a means to an end (i.e., good consequences should not justify evil means)

---
# Abstract moral principles 
.footnote[Cushman et al. (2006)]

The **rationalist model** of moral judgment says that individuals are *consciously aware* of the reasoning behind their moral decisions.

####Research question


 What principles do people tend to use to justify their answers to moral dilemmas?

---
# Abstract moral principles 
.footnote[Cushman et al. (2006)]

- Cushman et al. (2006) varied moral scenarios on three principles and asked people to *justify* their answers:

  - **The action principle**: It's morally worse if harm is caused by action rather than inaction.
  
  - **The intention principle**: It's morally worse if harming someone is a means to accomplish a goal than if harm occurs as a side effect of the goal.
  
  - **The contact principle**: It's morally worse to use physical contact to harm than it is to harm someone without using physical contact.

# Abstract moral principles 
.footnote[Cushman et al. (2006)]

The justifications were coded for:

- **Sufficiency**: the subject gave a difference between the two cases that accounted for their judgment
- **Failure**: the subject gave a difference between the two cases that could not account for their judgment
- **Uncertainty**: the subject was unsure about how to justify their responses
- **Denial**: the subject denied that they gave different responses
- **Alternative explanation**: the subject gave an alternative explanation (e.g., they clicked the wrong button)

# Normative theories 
.footnote[Aktas et al. (2017)]

Aktas et al. (2017) gave participants four moral dilemmas and had them choose whether the action to save the five people was "right" or "wrong"

#### Scenarios
1. The switch trolley dilemma (impersonal)
2. The footbridge trolley dilemma (personal)
3. Organ transplant (impersonal)
4. Organ transplant (personal)

???
Organ transplant personal -- a surgeon kills one patient and harvests their organs to save 5
Organ transplant impersonal -- a surgeon allows a nurse to kill a patient and then harvests their organs to save 5

# Normative theories
.footnote[Aktas et al. (2017)]

Additionally, participants were given five choices to justify their right or wrong judgment

- **Amoral**: Moral reasons did not play an important role in my judgment 

- **Deontology**: Intentionally harming an innocent person is against fundamental moral rules and is thus unacceptable regardless of its intended consequences 

- **Utilitarianism**: Moral action is what ensures the well-being of the maximum number of people

---

# Normative theories
.footnote[Aktas et al. (2017)]

Additionally, participants were given five choices to justify their right or wrong judgment

- **Virtue-ethical**: Someone who intentionally harms an innocent person cannot be moral

- **Fatalistic**: It is wrong to interfere with consequences that arise as a result of the natural course of events no matter what the ensuing harm is

# The rationalist model
.footnote[Haidt (2001)]

Let's revisit the rationalist model of moral judgment

![](images/rationalist_model.JPG)

Many philosophers and psychologists have argued that *affect* has a more direct role in determining a moral judgment than this model suggests

---
# Affect and moral judgments
.footnote[Greene et al. (2001)]


#### Method

Researchers gave participants moral-personal dilemmas (e.g., footbridge trolley dilemma), moral-impersonal dilemmas (e.g., the switch trolley dilemma), and non-moral dilemmas (e.g., choose between two coupons to use at a store)

- They then recorded their brain activity using fMRI
---
# Affect and moral judgments
.footnote[Greene et al. (2001)]

.pull-left[#### Results

- Moral-personal dilemmas involved areas of the brain associated with *emotion*

- Moral-impersonal and non-moral dilemmas involved areas of the brain associated with *working memory*]

They also found that solving moral dilemmas involved the same brain areas that are used in a stroop task, whether automatic process are being influenced/override by conscious processing

#Affect and moral judgments
.footnote[Koenigs et al. (2007); Cima et al. (2010); Bartels &amp; Pizzaro (2011)]

#### Bridge pushers
.smaller[- Individuals who have *damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex* (VMPC), an area involved
in generating emotions 
- Psychopaths (individuals who have deficits in emotional processing and inhibitory control)
- Utilitarians/ consequentialists (individuals who philosophize that the morality of an action should be judged on the consequences of the action, i.e., their moral philosophy requires them to suppress emotional responses)]

Based on these findings, emotion may play a more **direct role** in moral reasoning than the rationalist model suggests


---

# Summary
- Individuals find harmful actions much less morally acceptable when personal force is involved and when a person is using someone as a means to an end
- Some but not all moral reasoning is conscious; we cannot always justify our moral judgments
- Individuals prefer to endorse deontology over other moral philosophies
- Emotion plays an important role in moral judgments; without emotional capabilities, we reason that it is moral to use others to achieve the greater good
