# Moral emotions

.footnote[Haidt (2003)]

**Moral emotions** are emotions felt in response to the actors or actions in a moral situation

  - Feeling angry at injustice
  - Feeling guilty for hurting your friend
  - Feeling grateful for an act of kindness 

The most prototypical moral emotions have two prominent features: **disinterested elicitors** and **pro-social action tendencies**

# Disinterested elicitors

.footnote[Haidt (2003)]

- Typically, an emotion is elicited in a situation when something good or bad happens to the self

  - E.g., I am happy that I did well on the test
  - E.g., I am afraid that I will fall and hurt myself

- The elicitor is the event that causes the emotion; moral emotions have disinterested elicitors, meaning that they are frequently triggered for actions unrelated to the self
