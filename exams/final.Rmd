The purpose of the final paper is to learn about a moral psychology research topic that interests you but we were not able to fully explore in class. You will choose a topic, research it further, and write up a report.

# Choose a research question

Choose a research question from the following choices. I've added suggested initial readings to get you started. If you have your own idea for a research question, send me an e-mail or come talk to me about it in office hours, and I can help you refine it and choose some initial readings.
