# Defining and measuring morality
## Week 1 - Moral Psychology

---

# Week 1

In the first week, after a review of the syllabus, we will be exploring how philosophers and scientists have understood and measured morality.

.highlight[In week 1:]
- How will the course be structured? 
- How will my learning be assessed? 
- **How has morality been understood and defined?**
- **How do scientists measure morality?**

---
#Defining morality

Definitions of morality are either **descriptive** or **normative**

- **Normative**: morality is a code of conduct that would be agreed upon by all "rational" persons 
- **Descriptive**: morality is a system of morals that are endorsed by an individual or a group

  - Morality is whatever a group or individual thinks is moral
  - E.g., Catholic morality, Democrat morality, Nazi morality

#Defining morality

Definitions of morality are either **descriptive** or **normative**

- **Normative**: morality is a code of conduct that would be agreed upon by all "rational" persons 
- **Descriptive**: morality is a system of morals that are endorsed by an individual or a group

Philosophers generally create normative theories, debating what we *ought* to think is moral and how we *ought* to make moral judgments

Social scientists generally theorize descriptively, recording how individuals differ in their moral intuitions and theorizing about the psychological mechanisms underlying them 


.footnote[Zalta et al. (2020)]

# Five descriptive theories of morality

A good descriptive theory of morality needs to account for meaningful differences that arise within and between populations of individuals
  - It should be able to describe why one sibling is "pro-life" and the other "pro-choice", and why some cultures endorse "honor killings" while others find the practice abhorrent

# Five descriptive theories of morality

1. **Moral foundations theory**
3. The moral dyad: agent and patient
2. The model of moral motives
4. Relationship regulation
5. Circle of moral concern

# Moral foundations theory (MFT)

.left-column-big[Haidt has taken a **functionalist** approaches to defining morality, meaning that he describes something as moral if it fulfills a particular *function*

&gt;"Moral systems are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices, identities, institutions, technologies, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work together to **suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible.**"

.right[-Jonathan Haidt, 2010]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jonathan Haidt&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Social Psychologist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]


???
So anything that regulates/ suppresses selfishness can be considered moral by someone under this definition
---

# Moral foundations theory (MFT)

- Haidt proposed **moral foundations theory**, which posits that there are (at least) five moral intuitions. Individuals vary in how much they are willing to endorse or prioritize their moral intuitions
  - **Harm/care** - We should care for and not harm vulnerable others.
  - **Fairness/cheating** - We should get back what we put forward; we should not cheat.
  - **Ingroup/ betrayal** - We should be loyal to our groups (e.g., family, nation).
  - **Authority/ subversion** - We should respect authority and tradition.
  - **Purity/ Degradation** - We should not violate norms of decency and purity by doing certain things with our bodies.

  - **Liberty/ Oppression** - People should not restrict the freedom of others.

# The moral dyad: agent and patient

.left-column-big[However, Gray argues that, instead of five foundations, all foundations can be mapped onto a single harm principle: help/ do not harm

"Morality is essentially represented by a cognitive template that combines a **perceived intentional agent** with **a perceived suffering patient.**" 

.right[-Kurt Gray and colleagues, 2012]]

# The moral dyad: agent and patient
.footnote[Gray, Waytz, &amp; Young (2012)]
&lt;center&gt;![](images/gray_dyad.JPG) &lt;/center&gt;
When asked for a single moral act, people almost always say an act in which an agent causes harm to a patient

Acts that cause harm to a defenseless victim are the most easily accessible moral violations and are judged the most harshly
---
# The moral dyad: agent and patient
.footnote[Gray, Waytz, &amp; Young (2012)]
&lt;center&gt;![](images/gray2.JPG)&lt;/center&gt;
This causes agent/patient to become a cognitive template for a moral violation

---
# The moral dyad: agent and patient
.footnote[Gray, Waytz, &amp; Young (2012)]
&lt;center&gt;![](images/gray3.JPG) &lt;/center&gt;
The immoral agent/patient cognitive template can sometimes lead individuals to perceive a victim even when there is not one, especially when individuals personify the dead, animals, or groups

This model suggests that people do not have fundamentally different moralities, but instead disagree on which acts are harmful

# The model of moral motives (the MMM)
.footnote[Janoff-Bulman &amp; Carnes (2013)]

.left-column-big[Janoff-Bulman theorizes that morality requires us to regulate our behavior; it requires us to overcome temptations or desires to cheat, lie, and steal, and to be motivated to do good. She argues that MFT is an incomplete framework.

&gt;"Morality is generally recognized as a system of rules that facilitate and coordinate group living; as such **it involves behavioral regulation so as to optimize our existence as social beings.**" .right[-Janoff-Bulman &amp; Carnes, 2013]]

.right-column-small[![](images/ronnie_janoff-bulman.jpg)
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ronnie Janoff-Bulman&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Social Psychologist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]

---
# The Model of Moral Motives (the MMM)

- Janoff-Bulman proposed that all moral motives can be classified by the two **motivational systems** (approach or avoid) and the **focus of moral concern** (the self, another person, or the group)
  - **Motivational systems**: our approach motivational system designates moral beliefs about what we *ought to do* (called prescriptive morality) and our avoidance motivational system designates moral beliefs about what we *ought not to do* (called proscriptive morality)
  - **Focus of moral concern**: we have moral beliefs concerning what is virtuous for the self, for another person, and for the group

.footnote[Janoff-Bulman &amp; Carnes (2013)]
---
# The Model of Moral Motives (the MMM)

.footnote[Janoff-Bulman &amp; Carnes (2013)]
- The 2x3 MMM theorizes that moral motives can be classified as a motive to provide for the self, provide for another person, provide for the group (prescriptive regulation), or a motive to protect the self, protect another person, or protect the group (proscriptive regulation)
  - For example, a moral motive of protecting another person would yield a decision to not steal
.smallest-picture[![](images/MMM.JPG)]

???
We can classify moral beliefs from these six categories
The first row is what we believe should not do: we should not give into temptations, we should not cheat or steal, we should not disobey authority or be disloyal
The second row is what we should do: we should be hardworking and conscientiousness, we should help others, we should ensure social justice and equality for all

#  Relationship regulation theory of morality

.left-column-big[Rai (and Fiske) also believe that MFT does not fully capture the scope of moral disagreements. He argues that the determination of if an action is right or wrong cannot be determined outside of its social-relational context. 

"We must reconceptualize moral psychology as **embedded in our social-relational cognition**, such that moral judgments and behaviors emerge out of the specific obligations and transgressions entailed by particular types of social relationships."

# Relationship regulation theory of morality

- According to relational models theory, there are four types of mental models for relationships:
  - **Communal sharing**: individuals treat each other as equivalent, give and receive according to need, long term, e.g., families, teams 
  - **Authority ranking**: individuals are ranked along a social dimension, those who are higher in rank must protect those lower in rank, e.g., adults and children, military officers and soldiers
  - **Equality matching**: relationship based on balance and reciprocity, requires record keeping to know what has been exchanged, turn-based, e.g., exchanging Christmas cards
  - **Market pricing**: based on proportionality, each person gets what they deserve, e.g., buying and selling

.footnote[Fiske (2000); Fiske &amp; Haslam (2005)]


???
Two people can employ different relational mental models at different times, e.g., "Two friends may share tapes and records freely with each other (CS), work on a task at which one is an expert and imperiously directs the other (AR), divide equally the cost of gas (EM), and transfer a bicycle from one to the other for a market-value price (MP)" - Goldman (1993, pp. 344-345). 


---
#Relationship regulation theory of morality

- Relationship regulation theory posits that social-relational context is necessary for understanding beliefs about what is moral or immoral
- Cultural differences or meaningful differences in a population can arise when there are disagreements about which relational model is appropriate 
  - For example, one might perceive a family charging their child for rent as unethical if they believe a family relationship should be a communal sharing one (not a market pricing one)

  - .highlight[Discussion question:] what is another moral disagreement that may arise from differences in relational models?

# Circle of moral concern
.left-column-big[Others argue that meaningful differences arise when people differ in who they are concerned about. This idea was first theorized by W.E.H. Lecky and then later popularized by modern philosopher Peter Singer.

"At one time the benevolent affections embrace merely the family, soon the circle expanding includes first a class, then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity and finally, its influence is felt in the dealings of man with the animal world."

# Circle of moral concern
.right-column-big[![](images/moral_concern.JPG)]
.left-column-small[- Psychologist have found that individuals differ in who they have moral concerns for
- For example, children are more egocentric and many vegetarians/ vegans have higher moral concern for animals than meat-eaters do]

---

# A working definition of morality

To summarize:

- Morality pertains to how we ought to behave (and also how we think we ought to behave, which varies from individual to individual)
- We may have evolved moral intuitions regarding harm, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity
- Moral violations most often involve an intentional agent and a suffering victim
- Being moral often requires us to regulate selfish desires; we have moral rules about what we should do and what we should never do
- Morality cannot be understood without taking into account the context in which the action takes place
- People differ in who their moral concerns apply to

#Measuring morality

Psychologists generally measure morality through...

1. Self-report of behaviors or traits
2. Hypothetical moral dilemmas
3. Endorsement of abstract moral rules
4. Position on specific moral issues
5. Behavior

.footnote[Ellemers et al. (2019)]

---

# Self-report of behaviors or traits

.footnote[Lee &amp; Ashton (2018)]

- An example of a self-report measure of morality would be The HEXACO Personality Inventory **Honesty-Humility subscale**

- Individuals who score high on Honesty-Humility say that they don't manipulate others for personal gain and feel little temptation to break rules

--

Example items on the scale:

1. If I want something from a person I dislike, I will act very nicely toward that person in order to get it. (R)

2. I’d be tempted to use counterfeit money, if I were sure I could get away with it. (R)

---

# Hypothetical moral dilemmas 

A runaway trolley is headed for five people who will be killed if it proceeds on its present course. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto an alternate set of tracks where it will kill one person instead of five. Should you turn the trolley in order to save five people at the expense of one?

.footnote[Thomson (1976)]

.smaller-picture[![](images/trolley_switch_case.JPG)]

---

# Hypothetical moral dilemmas 

A trolley threatens to kill five people. You are
standing next to a large stranger on a footbridge
that spans the tracks, in between the oncoming
trolley and the five people. In this scenario, the
only way to save the five people is to push this
stranger off the bridge, onto the tracks below. He
will die if you do this, but his body will stop the
trolley from reaching the others. In order to save
the five others, should you push this stranger to
his death? 

.footnote[Thomson (1976)]

.smaller-picture[![](images/trolley_bridge.JPG)]
---

# Hypothetical moral dilemmas 
- Nearly everyone concludes that it is acceptable to sacrifice one life for five in the switch case but not in the footbridge case
- In both cases, we are sacrificing one person for five, but they lead to different answers
- We can study responses to hypothetical dilemmas like these to understand how we make moral decisions

---
#Abstract moral rules 

- We can also measure how likely individuals are to endorse abstract principles.

--

- For example, Haidt's **moral foundations theory** proposes that there are (at least) five moral intuitions
  - **Harm/care** - We should care for and not harm vulnerable others.
  - **Fairness/cheating** - We should get back what we put forward; we should not cheat.
  - **Ingroup/ betrayal** - We should be loyal to our groups (e.g., family, nation).
  - **Authority/ subversion** - We should respect authority and tradition.
  - **Purity/ Degradation** - We should not violate norms of decency and purity by doing certain things with our bodies.

# Position on specific moral issues

- We can give participants scales inquiring information about their position on specific moral issues
  - "Do you think abortion is wrong"?
  - "Do you think it is immoral to eat meat?"

---
# Behavioral measures

Psychologists can manipulate situations in a lab and measure whether the participants acting morally or immorally
  - **The dictator game:** participants in a lab experiment are paired up. One player is randomly assigned to be the "dictator." The "dictator" can give the other player as much money as they want. Researchers measure how much money the "dictator"  gives away.

--
  - Participants are given a task to do that earns them money. At the end, the researcher asks if the participant would be willing to donate some of their earnings. The researcher records how much money is donated.

---

#Behavioral measures

Psychologists can also try to measure moral behavior in naturalistic settings
- Researchers leave wallets across the country with a return address. They measure how many wallets get returned. 

???

# Summary

- There are many ways that psychologists have studied moral thinking and behavior. They have...
  - Asked individuals about their character traits
  - Asked individuals if they endorse abstract principles
  - Asked individuals if they belief specific acts are right or wrong 
  - Tested moral decisions in hypothetical moral situations
  - Measured moral/immoral behavior in a laboratory (e.g., economic games) and in naturalistic settings (e.g., wallets) by designing creative experiments
