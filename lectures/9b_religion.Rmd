####Image generation phase

- 800 stimuli were created by adding random noise to a base face 

- The base face was a composite of a black woman, black man, white woman, and black man

- Thus the stimuli varied on the prominence of feminine and racial features

#### Image generation phase
- Participants were presented with two faces at a time and asked to choose which face looks like a person who does not believe in God

- The researchers averaged the faces of the people who look like they believe in God (theists) and who do not look like they believe in God (atheists)

**Discussion question**

Where do you expect to see differences in ratings of the atheist face vs. the theist face?

# The representativeness heuristic

.pull-left[
- The **representativeness heuristic** is a biased mental shortcut that occurs when one categorizes something by judging how similar 
it is to its prototype 

  - When someone is representative of a group, we assume that they must be a member 
of that group]

???

i.e., if you give a description of an immoral act, do people make a conjunction error because they think that immoral acts are representative of atheists?

# Perceptions of atheists and theists
.footnote[Gervais (2014)]

**Incest scenario**

> Graeme and his sister were traveling together in France. One night they
were staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decided that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Graemeâ€™s sister was already taking
birth control pills, but Graeme used a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoyed it, but they decided not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to
each other.

**Chicken scenario**

> On the way home from work, Jack decided to stop at the butcher shop to
pick up something for dinner. He decided to roast a whole chicken. He
got home, unwrapped the chicken carcass, and decided to make love to it.
He used a condom, and fully sterilized the carcass when he was
finished. He then roasted the chicken and ate it for dinner alongside a
nice glass of Chardonnay.

**Discussion questions**

1. Why do you think people perceive atheists so negatively?

2. Do you think atheists are more likely to commit crimes than theists? Do you think that theists are more charitable than atheists?
