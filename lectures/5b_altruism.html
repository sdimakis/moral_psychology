# Altruism and reputation
## Week 5 - Moral Psychology

---


# Week 5
This week, we will be discussing moral behavior, particularly suppressing self-interest for the interests of others and the collective

.highlight-gray[In week 5:]

- What can economic games tell us about how we cooperate with each other?

- How trusting and generous are we towards strangers?

- **Does *true* altruism exist or are all pro-social acts inherently selfish?**

- **How concerned are we about being perceived as *moral* **?

# The missing wallet study
.footnote[Cohn et al. (2019)]
- Cohn et al. (2019) performed a missing wallet experiment in 40 countries with more than 17,000 wallets

- For each wallet, a research assistant walked into a building (banks, theaters, museums, post offices, hotels, police stations, courts of law,or other public offices) and said:

&gt;"Hi, I found this [pointing to the wallet] on the street around the corner. Somebody must have lost it. I’m in a hurry and have to go. Can you please take care of it?”

- They measured if the person did or did not contact the owner of the wallet

.left-column-med[- Some wallets had money in them while others had no money
- People were *more* likely to return wallets with money in them
- Across countries, about 40% of no money wallets were returned and about 51% of money wallets were returned]

.left-column-med[
- Further, when a "big money" condition ($94.15) was added, people were even more likely to return the wallet (see Figure)

- And in another variation, people were about 9% more likely to return wallets with keys

# The missing wallet study
.footnote[Cohn et al. (2019)]

.smallest-picture[![](images/cohn_5.JPG)]
- These findings were contrary to the expectations of expert economists, and contrary to the expectations of non-experts (see Figure)

- Extra monetary incentives *should* decrease wallet returns, but the opposite occurred

- A key, which is valuable to the wallet-owner but not the wallet-finder, should not increase wallet returns, but it does

# The dictator game
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;![](images/dg1.png) &lt;/center&gt;
- The dictator game is a simple variation of the ultimatum game 

- In this game, person A (called the "dictator") is given a sum of money, and they can choose to give a proportion to person B (or to give nothing at all)

- "Dictators" give on average 20% to 30% of the money to the other person

---
# Altrusim

From these studies, we have learned that people will sometimes act against their self-interest in order to help a stranger

- They will return wallets, especially ones with a lot of money, or ones that hold important valuables like keys

- They will share their rewards with strangers in economic games, even when there is no obvious opportunity for reciprocation 

---
# Altrusim

**Altruistic** behaviors are selfless actions that benefit other(s) without regard to how it will affect oneself

- Most "altruistic" behavior is done for those we love, like relatives or friends

  - **Kin selection**: helping those that share your genes   
  
  - **Reciprocal altruism**: helping others so that they will help you in the future 
  
- However, it is less obvious why people help strangers, especially ones they will never see again

--

&gt;.highlight-gray[Discussion question:] Think about a recent behavior that you did that was *altruistic*. Would you consider the act **purely** altruistic, or did you also benefit from it?

???

We also saw that monkeys were not helping strangers like we do
---

# Altruism 

.footnote[Batson and Shaw (1991)]
Batson and Shaw (1991) describe three pathways to helping, two of which are egoistic (i.e., selfish) and one of which they claim is altruistic


1. Arousal reducing (egoistic)

2. Reward seeking and punishment avoiding (egoistic)

3. Empathic concern (altruistic)

---
# Egoistic motivations for helping
.footnote[Batson and Shaw (1991)]

One reason for helping is **to reduce your own negative arousal** 

- When we see someone suffering, we feel emotional distress

- Helping them will reduce our own suffering and make us feel *good*

---
# Egoistic motivations for helping
.footnote[Cheng et al. (2010)]
.smallest-picture[![](images/pain-brain.png)]

- Participants were shown animated hands or feet in painful (e.g., a finger getting stuck in a door) and non-painful situations

- They were told to imagine it was their hand/foot, their love one's, or a stranger's

- **Conclusion**: similar pain regions of the brain are activated for the self and for others (especially close others)

--

Helping others *reduces our own suffering*, especially when someone we love is suffering

---

# Egoistic motivations for helping
.footnote[Batson and Shaw (1991)]

A second reason for helping is **to seek rewards and to avoid punishments**

- Helping can be rewarding for an individual because having a cooperative and helpful *reputation* is important 


&gt;.highlight-gray[Discussion question:] What is the benefit of appearing altrustic to others? How do people signal to others that they are virtuous?

# Protecting your moral reputation
.footnote[Vonasch et al. (2018)]

Study 3-4

.right-column-small[![](images/stress.jpg)]


- Participants took an IAT test

- They were randomly assigned to a low or high implicit racism score 
- Then, they were told that their score would be ranked against others scores and broadcast to the entire school

# Protecting your moral reputation

.footnote[Vonasch et al. (2018)]


Study 3-4

.right-column-small[![](images/stress.jpg)]

- They were then told that if they participated in another experiment, their score would not be included in the broadcast
  - The new task was disgusting or painful (worms or ice)

- 62.8% of participants with the (randomly assigned) high racism score were willing to endure a painful ice activity (30.4% put their hand in a bucket of worms)

# Dictator exit study
.footnote[Dana et al. (2005)]

Study 1

- Two participants sat across from each other and worked on an unrelated study

- At the end of the study, the participants read instructions for a dictator game 

&gt; You will be given $10, and you can give some to the other participant. The other participant will learn that you had $10 and decided to allocate X number of dollars to them. How much would you like to give?
  
- Participants indicated how much money they would like to give the other participant
  
---

# Dictator exit study
.footnote[Dana et al. (2005)]

Study 1

- Then, dictators were given a second choice: to take $9 (instead of the $10) to *exit the game*

- If they choose this option, they will walk away with $9 and the other participant will never learn of the game's existence 

---

# Dictator exit study
.footnote[Dana et al. (2005)]

Study 1

.pull-right[![](images/dg_exit_2.JPG)]

.pull-left[- 28% of "dictators" took the exit option

- **Conclusion**: people give because they want to *appear* selfless and fair, but they would actually rather keep the money]


---

# Dictator exit study
.footnote[Dana et al. (2005)]

Study 2

- Participants were either in the *public* condition (same as study 1) or the *private* condition

- In the private condition, the receiver will not know where the money came from. The money will be given to them with the following note:
  
&gt; "Thank you for your time today. An additional payment of $___ is attached to this note."

- In the private condition, after making an allocation decision, participants were also given the choice to exit and take $9

---

# Dictator exit study
.footnote[Dana et al. (2005)]
Study 2

.pull-left[- In the private condition, only one person chose to exit

- There was not a significant difference in gift size between the private and public condition

- **Conclusion**: people exit in the public condition because they are concerned about what the person will think about their gift (e.g., is it big enough?) but even when the gift is private, people feel compelled to give]

# Moral credentials

.footnote[Monin &amp; Miller (2001)]


- Participants were randomly assigned to the credentials condition, the no credentials condition, or the base-rate condition

- In the credentials and no credentials condition, participants filled out a short survey about their perceptions of women 

- In the base-rate condition, they did not fill out any survey

---
# Moral credentials

.footnote[Monin &amp; Miller (2001)]
#### The credentials condition

- Most women are better off at home taking care of the children.

- Men are more emotionally suited for politics than are most women.

- The best job for most women is something like cook, nurse, or teacher.

- Most women need a man to protect them.

- Most women are not really smart.


???
In this condition, participants have the opportunity to build up credibility that they are not sexist

# Moral credentials

.footnote[Monin &amp; Miller (2001)]

Participants then read the following:

&gt; Imagine that you are the manager of a small (45-person) cement
manufacturing company based in New Jersey. Last year was a particularly good one, and after you invested in increasing the outputcapacity of your plant, you decide that it would be very fruitful if you
could find clients in other states to increase your business. Because
you cannot spend too much time away from the plant, you decide to
appoint someone to go around to prospective clients and negotiate
contracts. This is a highly specialized market, and the job will mostly
consist in going from one building site to another, establishing contacts with foremen and building contractors. It is also a highly competitive market, so bargaining may at some points be harsh. Finally,
it's a very technical market, and a representative that did not exude
confidence in their technical skills would not be taken seriously by
potential clients. Realizing how useful such a help would be for you,
you decide to give the person chosen one of the top-five salaries in
your company. Do you feel that this job is better suited for one gender
rather than the other?

---


# Moral credentials

.footnote[Monin &amp; Miller (2001)]

.smallest-picture[![](images/monin cred.JPG)]

- Overall, women preferred a man for the job at the same rate, regardless of the condition they were in

- However, men with "moral credentials" (who had just stated that they were not sexist) preferred a man for the job at a higher rate than men who did not have "moral credentials"

--

- **Conclusion:** people are more likely to express an attitude that could be considered prejudiced when they have a reputation of not being prejudiced 

---

# An "altruistic" motivation for helping
.footnote[Batson and Shaw (1991)]

- Batson and Shaw (1991) argue that **empathic concern** is a purely altruistic motivation for helping someone else

- Empathy is both cognitive and affective

  - Cognitive empathy is being able to think about a situation from another person's perspective
  
  - Emotional empathy is being able to feel what another person feels 

- Even when people know that there is no reward for helping (or are even facing a big consequence), people help strangers
  - e.g., people who hid Jews in Nazi Germany

# Empathy is unreliable and flawed
.footnote[Bloom (2013)]
&gt; "Newtown, in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, was inundated with so much charity that it
became a burden. More than eight hundred volunteers were recruited to deal with the gifts that were
sent to the city—all of which kept arriving despite earnest pleas from Newtown officials that charity be
directed elsewhere. A vast warehouse was crammed with plush toys the townspeople had no use for; millions
of dollars rolled in to this relatively affluent community. We felt their pain; we wanted to help. Meanwhile—
just to begin a very long list—almost twenty million American children go to bed hungry each night, and the
federal food-stamp program is facing budget cuts of almost twenty per cent."

---
# The identifiable victim effect

**The identifiable victim effect** is the tendency to be moved by the plight of a single individual than by a large number of individuals


.smallest-picture[![](images/slovic.JPG)]

- Small, Loewenstein, and Slovic (2007) gave participants $5 and then recorded how much of it they donated to the *Save the Children* organization

- Half of the participants were given statistics about starvation in Africa and half of the participants saw a picture of a girl and read a description about her

--
- **Conclusion:** people donated over twice as much for an identifiable victim than for statistics about the issue

???

The intervention condition means that they learned about the identifiable victim effect before donating
---

# An "altruistic" motivation for helping

Batson and Shaw (1991) argue that empathic concern is the only way to reach purely unselfish altruism, but according to Paul Bloom, empathy is often a poor compass for moral action

&gt;.highlight-gray[Discussion question:] Are you convinced by Bloom's argument? Do you think the world would be more moral if people were more empathetic, or if people were more rational? 

&gt;.highlight-gray[Discussion question:] Does it matter if something is *truly* altruistic? Or is a good act still good, even when the motivations are selfish? 

---


# Summary

- People often go out of their way to help others, but even strangers 

- There are selfish reasons to be altruistic, such as to feel good or to build a moral reputation

- People care *a lot* about whether others think they are moral

  - Many are willing to experience pain (or even die) to maintain their moral reputation
  
  - People want to be as altruistic as others expect them to be 
  
  - Some people care so much about their moral reputation that they censor their attitudes for audiences who are unaware of their "moral credentials"
  
- Empathy may be the key to "pure" altruism, but empathy may not always lead to moral decision making
