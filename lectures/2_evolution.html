# Evolution and development
## Week 2 - Moral Psychology

---



# Week 2

This week we will be discussing moral insights from research on animals and human infants and children

.highlight[In week 2:]
- How can natural selection, which touts "survival of the fittest," account for the evolution of moral organisms?
- Are pieces of our moral intuitions present in nonhuman animals?
- Are children capable of moral reasoning and moral behavior?
- How do we develop moral judgments across the lifespan?

---

# Darwin's theory of evolution 

.footnote[Darwin (1859)]

- Darwin proposed that organisms evolve primarily through *natural selection*
  - Organisms in a given population naturally vary on heritable traits (e.g., height)
  - When a particular variant of a trait is adaptive (e.g., being tall), individuals with the adaptive form of the trait are more likely to survive and reproduce
  - Thus adaptive traits are more likely to be passed on to subsequent generations

# The evolution of morality

Altruistic behavior has puzzled evolutionary biologists and psychologists because it seemingly conflicts with the theory of natural selection

Individuals who steal, cheat, deceive, and hoard resources would have a better chance of surviving and reproducing


So why do some individuals sacrifice their lives to save another life, or sacrifice their time and earnings to help those who are suffering, when these actions can reduce their chances of surviving and reproducing? 

---

# A veneer theory of human morality

- Veneer theory was endorsed by many biologists in the 20th century
- It posits that humans are inherently selfish and amoral beings and underneath a thin "veneer" of morality lies an amoral, selfish animal
- This theory implies that humans are the only moral animal because morality requires .highlight[self-regulation and self-control] that other animals do not have
.right-column-big[![](images/veneer.jpg)]

# A veneer theory of human morality
.footnote[Darwin (1871)]
.left-column-big["Of all the differences between man and the lower animals, the moral sense or conscience is by far the most important."

# Moral behavior of primates

.right-column-bigger[![](images/tree2.JPG)]
- In order to understand how humans evolved to have moral senses and to determine if other animals have moral capabilities, we should first observe the behavior of our closest evolutionary relatives: bonobos and chimpanzees

---

# Bonobos and chimpanzees

.left-column-med[
- Both bonobos and chimpanzees live in Sub-Saharan Africa, separated by the Congo river
- North of the Congo river, where chimpanzees live, there is less rainfall and more competition for food; south of the Congo river, where bonobos live, food is abundant and competition is limited
- These different environmental pressures led to large differences in behavior between the two species]

.right-column-med[![](images/Bonobo_vs_chimp.png)]

???
The congo river is very wide so they can't swim across
For example, some gorillas and chimps live in the same areas, where gorillas  eat what is on the ground, so chimps have to find food elsewhere

# Is vaneer theory supported?

- While bonobos are relatively peaceful, chimps can be very violent
- Bonobo females ban together to form strong alliances, but chimpanzee males often hurt females and children for their own benefit
--

- .highlight[Discussion question:] can understanding the behavior of our closest relatives (chimps and bonobos) tell us anything about human morality? Are we chimps with self-control (as veneer theory would suggest), or is something else going on?


---
# The "Beethoven" error
- Beethoven was incredibly disorganized and messy; nonetheless, surrounded by chaos, he created beautiful works of art
- Therefore, it would be an error to say that beauty cannot result from a disorderly, chaotic process
- In the same way, while natural selection can be cruel and ruthless, it would be an error to say that it can only result in cruel and ruthless creatures


.footnote[Frans de Waal (2006)]

---

# A naturalistic theory of human morality
- Natural selection favors organisms with adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce and lying, cheating, and harming others is not the only way to survive and reproduce
- For social animals (animals that live in groups) like humans, moral intuitions about harm, fairness, loyalty, etc. allow us to peacefully cooperate with members of our group
- Thus all social animals should have, to some extent, evolved moral intuitions 

If we evolved morality from living in social groups, then we should be able to detect at least rudimentary forms of moral intuitions in nonhuman social animals

.footnote[Frans de Waal (2006)]

# Altruistic worker ants
.smallest-picture[![](images/exploding_ant.jpg)]
Some species of worker ants have cavities full of poisonous glue in their body that they will explode to protect the rest of their colony

The explosion will likely save the colony but will kill the altruistic ant

--

Kin altruism is common in the animal kingdom; But, do nonhuman animals care about protecting and providing for group members that they are not genetically related to?

# Protecting behavior in rats
.footnote[Rice &amp; Gainer (1962)]

.left-column-med[
- Rice and Gainer (1962) tested if rats would expend effort to help another rat who was suffering
- **Training session:** first, experimenters trained the rats to learn that pressing a lever would lower a styrofoam block that was suspended by a harness]

.right-column-med[![](images/rats_training.JPG)]

???
They were trained to lower the foam via shocks, i.e., they would be shocked if they did not press the lever 
---

# Protecting behavior in rats
.right-column-bigger[
- **Experiment**: Rice and Gainer (1962)  suspended rat B by a harness in full view of rat A; rat B showed signs of distress, squealing and wriggling to try to get free
  - Researchers measured whether Rat A would press the lever and relieve rat B of distress
- **Results:** Rats pushed the lever on average 14.6 times (compared to .8 times for rats in the control group who were presented with the styrofoam block)]
.footnote[Rice &amp; Gainer (1962)] 
.left-column-smaller[&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;![](images/albino_rats.JPG)]


???

The control condition had a styrofoam block raised up by a harness instead of a rat. If pressed, the bar would lower the rat 
This experiment happened over 5 10-minute trials. when the rats realized that pressing the level would lower the other rat, they pressed it at increasing frequency, but when they realized the lever would lower the foam, they did not press it at increasing frequency suggesting that the rats were motivated to relieve the distress of the suspended rat

# Protecting behavior in primates

.footnote[Masserman et al. (1964)]

.left-column-med[- Masserman et al. (1964) tested if monkeys were willing to forgo food in order to save another monkey from harm
- **Training session:** first, experimenters trained rhesus monkeys to pull one chain in response to a blue light and another chain in response to a red light in order to obtain a pellet of food
- Two days into training, another monkey was placed in the compartment to the right of the first monkey]
.right-column-med[![](images/monkey_chains.JPG)]

---
# Protecting behavior in primates 
.footnote[Masserman et al. (1964)]

- Four days into training, when the monkey pulled on one of the chains to get food, Masserman et al. (1964) administered a shock to the monkey in the adjacent compartment 
- **Results**: 10/15 monkeys preferred to pull the chain that did not shock the other monkey
  - One monkey did not pull either chain for 5 days and another did not pull either chain for 12 days after seeing it shock the other monkey
  - These monkeys were willing to starve to not harm the neighboring monkey

--

.highlight[Discussion question:] Are these rats and monkeys helping because they feel empathy? How may their motivations and responses differ from human motivations and responses?

???
Monkeys may be more likely to help monkeys they know but may not have moral concerns for those who are strangers
---

# Providing behavior in primates 
.footnote[Horner et al. (2011)] 
.right-column-med[![](images/tokens.JPG)]
- Horner et al. (2011) tested whether chimpanzees were concerned with helping other chimps (not just preventing harm)
- For the experiment, two chimps were held in adjacent compartments
-  The researcher offered one of the chimps a bucket of 30 evenly distributed red and green tokens
- The chimps learned that if they choose the red token (the selfish token), then only they will get food, but if they choose a green token (the prosocial token), both chimps would get food

---

# Providing behavior in primates
.footnote[Horner et al. (2011)] 
.right-column-med[![](images/resultshorner.JPG)]
- Horner et al. (2011) found that chimps were willing to help; they choose the prosocial token more than chance (50%)
- The monkey's willingness to choose the prosocial token increased when the other chimp was making noise indicating that they were hungry (coded as attention-giving) but decreased when the other chimp was trying to intimidate (coded as DRP)

???

attention-giving (self-scratching, noise, food-grunts, or hitting the caging)
directed requests and pressure = DRP (throwing paper toward other monkey, spitting water, begging, hooting)


---
# Providing behavior in primates
.footnote[de waal et al. (2008)] 
.right-column-med[![](images/resultsdewaal.jpg)]
- In a similar paradigm, Capuchin monkeys were offered a selfish token or a pro-social token
- This time, the researchers varied whether or not the other monkey was an unrelated group member, related, a stranger, or anonymous 
- de Waal et al. (2008) found that monkeys were less concerned with helping strangers or helping anonymously 

???
In the anonymous condition, the researchers put up an opaque partition so that the monkeys could see each other through a small peephole, but they could not see each other accept or consume the rewards

---

# Summary: providing and protecting 

- Non-human animals have been found to expend effort to reduce the suffering of others
  + Some monkeys are willing to even forgo food to prevent other monkeys from being shocked
- Non-human animals have also been found to provide for others
  + They prefer to help groupmates and kin than to help strangers
  + They are much less likely to help when the donation is anonymous 

---
# Fairness in nonhuman animals

.left-column-big[![](images/little_red_hen.jpg)]

???
The Little Red Hen is a children's story about a hen who wants to make bread

She asked her friends if they would help her, but no one wanted to. At the end of the story, her friends wanted to eat the bread, but she concluded that that was unfair because they didn't help her make it

--

Do nonhuman animals distribute resources fairly?
Do they react negatively to violations of fairness?
---
# Reciprocity in vampire bats

.right-column-med[![](images/vampire_bat.png)]
- Vampire bats exclusively feed on blood; they can only survive about two days without it
- If they cannot find any from an animal, they need to beg another vampire bat to regurgitate some of their meal
- Thus they form cooperative, reciprocal relationships with nonrelated members of their group

Helping so that you will be helped in the future is called **reciprocal altruism** 
---
# Fairness in primates
.footnote[de Waal &amp; Berger (2000)]
- de Waal and Berger (2000) tested whether monkeys were more willing to share their food with another monkey when the other monkey helped obtain it
- The researchers first trained capuchin monkeys to pull food toward themselves using a metal bar
.right-column-med[![](images/fairness_monkeys.JPG)]
- In one condition, the monkey was able to pull the food in alone (the solo condition), but in the other condition, the monkey needed help to pull the food in (the cooperation condition)
---
# Fairness in primates

.footnote[de Waal &amp; Berger (2000)]
.right-column-med[![](images/fairness_monkeys2.JPG)]
- de Waal and Berger (2000) found that the monkeys generally were very willing to spontaneously share food, even if they did all of the work to obtain it
- They also found that they share about 1-2 more pieces on average when the other monkey helped obtain the food


---
# Fairness in primates

.footnote[Brosnan &amp; de Waal (2003)]
.right-column-med[![](images/grape_cucumber.JPG)]
- Brosnan &amp; de Waal (2003) tested whether monkeys were bothered by violations of fairness
- First, they trained capuchin monkeys to trade rocks for food rewards
- The rewards were cucumbers or grapes; the monkeys liked the cucumbers but strongly preferred the grapes
- The researcher would have both monkeys trade the rocks for food, but would give one monkey a cucumber and the other monkey a grape
---
# Fairness in primates
.footnote[Brosnan &amp; de Waal (2003)]
.right-column-med[![](images/reject_reward.JPG)]
- Brosnan &amp; de Waal (2003) found that the monkey with the cucumber reward (the inferior reward) would refuse to except the reward and refuse to exchange the rocks for cucumbers

![](images/brosnan2003.JPG)

???
ET = equality test (both monkeys receive cucumbers)
IT = inequality test (one monkey cucumber, other monkey grape)
EC = effort control (food was handed to the monkeys with no exchange at all)
FC = food control  (the monkey exchanged for the cucumber; the other monkey was absent but the grape was place it the spot where the other monkey was)
---
# Inequity aversion
There are two types of inequity aversion:
  1. **Disadvantageous inequity aversion:** being averse to inequity that disadvantages you (e.g., being adverse to receiving a cucumber while the other monkey receives a grape)
  2. **Advantageous inequity aversion:** being averse to inequity that advantages you (e.g., being averse to receiving a grape while the other monkey receives a cucumber)
  
Monkeys exhibit behavior consistent with the first but not the second
---
# Advantageous inequity aversion

Advantageous IA might be unique to humans; very few monkeys refuse advantageous rewards

.smallish-picture[![](images/white_protest.jpg)]

---

# Summary: fairness/ justice

- Many nonhuman animals engage in reciprocal exchanges of resources, especially for kin
- Primates are willing to share resources with non-kin group members and especially with those that help them obtain it
- Primates sometimes refuse rewards that are unfair

These findings suggest that primates distribute resources and expect resources to be distributed (at least reasonably) fairly

???
A cucumber reward is simply not reasonable

.footnote[Warneken &amp; Tomasello (2006)]
- In the experimental condition, the experimenter would alternate his gaze between the child and the object and then verbalize his problem (e.g., "my marker!")
- In the control condition, the experimenter would look at the object with a neutral face for 20 seconds
- The child did not receive any praise or reward for helping
- The child was presented with 5 control trials and 5 experimental trials, and the experimenter recorded how many times the child helped

#Infant research

For most tasks, the infants were more likely to help in the experimental conditions than in the control conditions

---
#Infant research
.footnote[Warneken &amp; Tomasello (2006)]

This research finding implies that these pre-verbal infants were able to distinguish between when a stranger needed help vs. didn't need help AND that they were motivated to help them 

.highlight[Discussion question]: How (if at all) do these findings differ from what we discussed about the altruistic behavior in chimpanzees and other primates?

# Infant research
.footnote[Hamlin et al. (2007)]

- Hamlin et al. (2007) showed infants (5 to 10 months old) live shows with animated, wooden shapes
- In the show, a red circle would be attempting to climb a hill
- In some shows, another character would enter the scene and interact with the climber
- For example, the yellow triangle (left) helps the red circle up the hill, while the blue square (right) pushes the red circle down the hill

# Infant research
.footnote[Hamlin et al. (2007)]
Study 1
- Infants watched the helping show and hindering show back to back until they became disinterested (no longer looking at the show, suggesting that they had fully processed it)
- Infants were then asked to choose which toy they would like to play with - the yellow triangle (the helper) or the blue square (the hinderer)
- Researchers recorded which toy the infant reached for first
- 12/12 6-month-olds and 14/16 10-month-olds reached for the helper 


---
# Infant research
.footnote[Hamlin et al. (2007)]
Study 2
- Researchers wanted to know if infants choose the yellow 
triangle because it was helpful, or because of other intrinsic properties (e.g., because they preferred objects moving uphill, are yellow, or are triangles)
- They designed a second experiment where the only change was that the triangle was pushing a red ball (no eyes) up a hill and the blue square was pushing a red ball down the hill

![](images/wynn4.JPG)
---
# Infant research
.footnote[Hamlin et al. (2007)]
.right-column-med[![](images/bloomwynn2.png)]
- The researchers found that when the object being pushed up or down the hill was a ball, then the infants did not prefer the yellow triangle over the blue square
- This suggests that infants preferred the yellow triangle in study 1 because they have already (at 6 months) developed a preference for good over bad characters
--

- .highlight[Discussion question]: Do these studies prove that knowing the difference between good and bad actions are innate? 

---

# Lawrence Kohlberg
.footnote[Kohlberg, 1968]
Kohlberg conducted a 12 year longitudinal study, presenting the same moral dilemmas to boys at different time points in their lives, from childhood to early adulthood 

For example, he asked his participants:

&gt;"Should the doctor mercy kill a fatally ill woman requesting death because of her pain?"
---

# Richard's responses to the mercy killing dilemma

Age 13: "If she requests it, it's really up to her. She is in such terrible pain, just the same as people are always putting animals out of their pain."

Age 16: "I don't know. In one way, it's murder, it's not a right or privilege of man to decide who shall live and who should die. God put life into everybody on earth and you're taking away something from that person that came directly from God, and you're destroying something that is very sacred..."

Age 24: "A human life takes precedence over any other moral or legal value, whoever it is. A human life has inherent value whether or not it is valued by a particular individual. The worth of the individual human being is central where the principles of justice and love are normative for all human relationships." 

---

#  Kohlberg's stage theory
.footnote[Kohlberg, 1968]

- **Pre-conventional level**: right and wrong is determined through rewards and punishments
- **Conventional level**: right and wrong is determined by expectations and rules from family, group, and/or nation
- **Post-conventional level**: right and wrong is determined by autonomous, abstract moral principles

???
Pre-conventional (children): the individual is concerned with themself only; something is wrong when they get punished for it; something is right when they get rewarded for it. They are not considering others or society

Conventional (adolescents and most adults): the individual is concerned with what others think; they are concerned with laws but not just because they are avoiding punishment but because they are motivated to maintain social order

Post-conventional (some adults): Most adults never reason at this level; you reason like a philosopher 

---
# Kohlberg's stage theory
.footnote[Kohlberg, 1968]

![](images/kohlberg_stages.JPG)
???
Stage 1: e.g., a child avoids a behavior because they were punished for it
Stage 2: e.g., a child helping clean because they were offered ice cream
Stage 3: e.g., they want to be "good" because they want others to like them 
Stage 4: laws should not be broken, e.g., you should not steal because it is against the law and the law is important or else there would not be chaos
Stage 5: focused on individual rights; e.g., you can steal if your family is starving because people should have the right to life, to not suffer
Stage 6: like a philosopher; e.g., the golden rule (treat others like you want to be treated); the categorical imperative; Kant's categorical imperative  (act only in a way in which you would want the act to become universal law)
--

.highlight[Q]: Which stage do you think primates reason at? What about psychopaths?  

 
---

# A criticism of Kohlberg's theory

Kohlberg's stage theory implies that adults who do not reason at the post-conventional level are morally deficient 

  - Some cultures do not have adults at level 3 (Gibbs et al., 2007) because level 3 reasoning relies on individual rights which are de-emphasized in some cultures (e.g., collectivistic cultures)
  - Kohlberg used this model to claim that women have inferior moral reasoning abilities; some (e.g., Kohlberg's student Carol Gilligan (1982)) have argued that women reason differently, focusing more on interpersonal relationships than individual rights

???
  - The theory was developed on a very WEIRD sample (western, white, upper-class boys)
  - This theory is surprisingly secular. It assumes that religion plays no role in moral development
  
---

# Social domain theory
.footnote[Turiel (1983)]

Elliot Turiel developed social domain theory in the late 70s and early 80s.

- **Social domain theory**: moral development is driven by a child's interactions with their social environment 
  + Children learn rules from their social interactions about how they should act in social situations
  + They learn rules that can be categorized into three different social domains 
  + The social domains develop in parallel and follow different developmental trajectories
  
???
That they develop in parallel is distinct from Kohleberg, who theorized that morality develops in stages
  
  
---
# SDT: the three social domains
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]
- The three social domains:
  - **Psychological domain**: private personal preferences that do not violate the rights or welfare of others
  - **Societal domain**: normative rules about tradition, authority, and social norms and convention that coordinate social interactions
  -  **Moral domain**: prescriptive judgments about justice, welfare, and rights

  
---
# SDT: the moral domain
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]

Rules in **the moral domain** are obligatory, universally acceptable, and not determined through consensus/ institutional convention

- A moral transgression is wrong because of intrinsic features of the act (e.g., it is harmful), not because an institution says so 

For example, a child learns that hitting is wrong. Hitting is wrong even if an authority figure or institution says its OK because hitting harms others. 

---
#SDT: the societal domain
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]

Social conventions are shared across a group of people and they determine which behaviors are appropriate for a given context (e.g., etiquette)
- Social conventions are arbitrary; another social convention could be substituted to fill the same role

E.g., a child learns that they need to wear their uniform to school (a blue shirt and black pants). This rule is arbitrary because a purple shirt could be substituted and the purpose of the uniform is fulfilled; there is no reason that the shirt needs to be blue   

---
#SDT: the psychological domain
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]

Personal issues are distinct from social conventions because they occur in private or only concern an individual; personal issues are distinct from moral rules because they do not violate the rights or welfare of others

E.g., a child learns that they (and others) have different food preferences and that everyone has the freedom to choose what to eat based on those preferences

---
#SDT: moral vs. societal domains
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]

- Children construct the moral domain through empathy and through observing negative consequences when the rule is violated
  - In social interactions, a child observes (either because they are a victim or an observer) that immoral actions uniquely cause emotional distress to a victim 
  - These actions are then assigned moral status, whereas interactions that do not lead to emotional distress are not

- Simultaneously, children are also constructing the societal domain by witnessing the arbitrary rules and expectations in their given culture
  - When a convention is violated, there is rarely emotional distress/ a victim

???
Children learn that moral rules exist due to intrinsic features of the act, while social conventions exist to maintain social order. Conventions are arbitrary; another rule could fit the purpose just as well 
Example: Wearing red vs. wearing black to a funeral

---
#Evidence for Social domain theory
.footnote[Smetana (1981)]
Children aged 2-9 rated 10 moral and conventional social rules on how serious the rule is, how much a person should be punished for breaking the rule, and how permissible the rule would be in the absence of a rule 

1. One child hitting another child. (M)
2. A child not sharing a toy. (M)
3. A child shoving another child. (M)
4. A child throwing water at another child. (M)
5. A child taking another child's apple. (M)
6. A child not participating in show and tell. (C)
7. A child not sitting in the designated place (on the rug) during story time.(C) 
8. A child not saying grace before snack. (C)
9. A child putting a toy away in the incorrect place. (C)
10. A child not placing her belongings in the designated place. (C)

???
This is just an example of a study that supports this theory
---
#Evidence for Social domain theory
.footnote[Smetana (1981)]
- Moral transgressions were rated as more serious and deserving of stricter punishment than conventional transgressions
- Conventional transgressions were rated as more permissible in the absence of a rule than moral transgressions
  - The harm transgressions (hitting, shoving, and throwing water) were rated not permissible by everyone, while the fairness transgression (stealing an apple) was only rated as not permissible by older kids

This is evidence that children (even very young children) distinguish between and treat moral rules and social conventions differently
---



# A criticism of social domain theory

- The moral/ conventional distinction is not always pronounced
  - Many non-Western cultures treat acts as moral that Westerners would call social conventions
  - An act may be considered moral in one context but a convention in another (e.g., an act was considered moral historically but now is not)

E.g., some people think that kneeling for a flag is a violation of a social convention, while others think that it is a moral violation. This theory is unable to answer exactly how this disagreement develops
---

# Summary

- Infants as early as 6 months old reliably prefer to play with nice toys over mean toys
- Infants as early as 18 months are willing to help strangers, even though they are not personally benefiting 
- Kohlberg theorized that morality developed in stages    
  - The final stage (that most adults never reach) is to make moral judgments through consistent abstract principles rather than because of rewards or punishment, obeying authority, and/or societal pressures
- Turiel theorized that children construct the moral domain through social interactions
  - Crucial to constructing the moral domain is learning to distinguish moral rules (which are invariable/ exist because of intrinsic properties of the act itself) and social conventions (which are arbitrary and fluid)
