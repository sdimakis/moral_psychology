# Self-concept maintenance
## Week 7 - Moral Psychology

---


# Week 7

This week, we will be discussing the moral self. 

.highlight-blue[In week 7:]

- How central is morality to one's self-concept?

- What is a *moral identity* and how to we measure it?

- **How do we maintain that we are a good person, even when we violate our own moral standards?**


---

# Activity

Think of a number between 1 and 5. I will give extra credit to anyone who is thinking the same number as me. Write down your guess and name on a piece of paper so that I can later assign extra credit. Please don't cheat by going to the website and looking at the next slide.

# Activity


The number I was thinking of was 2.

# The moral self

.footnote[Bryan, Adams, &amp; Monin (2013)]

####Method

- Researchers asked for volunteers for a study about psychokinesis

- Participants flipped a coin 10 times, and were asked to try to influence the outcome "with their minds"

- They would receive $1 for every flip that landed on heads

---

# The moral self

.footnote[Bryan, Adams, &amp; Monin (2013)]

####Method 

Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two versions of a warning or to recieve no warning at all (the control condition):

- **NOTE**: Please donâ€™t [cheat/be a cheater] and report that one or more
of your coin flips landed heads when it really landed tails! Even a
small [amount of cheating/number of cheaters] would undermine the
study, making it appear that psychokinesis is real.

# The moral self

.footnote[Bryan, Adams, &amp; Monin (2013)]

.pull-left[
####Results
- Participants claimed significantly less money (indicating less cheating) when they read "please don't be a cheater" than when they read "please don't cheat"

- "Please don't cheat" did not significantly reduce cheating from no warning at all

# The moral self

.footnote[Bryan, Adams, &amp; Monin (2013)]

####Discussion

- Most people are highly motivated to maintain a positive self-concept, to think of ourselves as *good* 

- An individual can cheat a little amount without it threatening their self-concept but will refrain from cheating when it does threaten their self-concept

--
.dq[.smaller[Should we apply this everywhere, e.g., "please don't be a litterer," "please don't be a drunk driver"?]]

???

or do you foresee any negative consequences of this style of behavior change?


E.g., it's not clear what effect it will have on one's identity. Will many come to see themselves as a cheater and their behavior increase?

---

# Self-concept maintenance 

.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]

**Self-concept maintenance theory** of dishonest behavior states that individuals are torn between benefiting from cheating and maintaining a positive self-concept
  
.pull-right[![](images/speeding.jpg)]

.pull-left[People are able to compromise by cheating a little, but only enough so that it does not threaten their positive self-concept]

???

E.g., everyone has a number in which they are comfortable going over the speed limit without feeling like a reckless person. Can ask class what their number is.

---

# Self-concept maintenance 

.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]

- Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008) propose two mechanisms that allow a person to balance cheating with their positive self-concept

  - **Attention to standards**: When people are not attending to their moral standards, they are less likely to follow them 
  

???


You can remind them of moral rules by having them recite the 10 commandments, for example (like in the last lecture)

Stealing pencils vs. money from work, or stealing tokens vs. money (experiment we talked about in dishonesty lecture). Would you steal money out of a college dorm vs. some milk?

Reminder of the matrix task

# Attention to standards 

.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]

#### Method (study 1)

- Participants were given 20 matrices to solve in 4 minutes

- They were told that two people would be randomly selected at the end of the experiment to earn $10 for every solved matrix

--

- Random assignment to two conditions
  - **Recycle condition** OR **control** (hand to experimenter)
  
  - **10 commandments condition** OR **Control** (list 10 books you read in high school)


---

# Attention to standards

.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]


.pull-left[#### Results (study 1)

- In the control condition (not able to cheat), participants completed about 3 matrices on average

- In the recycle condition, participants cheated after reciting books they read in high school but not after reciting the commandments]

.pull-right[![](images/mazar study 1.JPG)]


---

# Attention to standards

.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]

.pull-left[#### Discussion (study 1)
- Individuals are less likely to cheat when they are reminded of their moral values

- People only cheated about 1-2 matrices on average (they could have solved up to 20 matrices)
]

.pull-right[![](images/mazar study 1.JPG)]


---

# Attention to standards

.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]

.pull-left[####Discussion (study 1)
- There was an insignificant correlation between number of commandments that a person could recall and their matrix score in the recycle condition

# Attention to standards

.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]

#### Method (study 2)

- Participants were given 20 matrices to solve in 4 minutes

- Participants were randomly assigned to one of the six combinations:

  - **50 cents** per matrix or **$2** per matrix
  
  - **Control** or **Recycle** or **Recycle + honor code**
  

---

# Attention to standards 

.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]


.pull-left[#### Results (study 2)

- In the recycle condition, people claimed about two more matrices when they did not see an honor code 

- The money manipulation was not significant, although this may be because $.50 is not different enough from $2]

# Categorization
.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]
#### Method (study 3)
- Participants were given 20 matrices to solve in 5 minutes

- They were also given $10 in an envelope and told that for every matrix that they solved, they would get 50 cents from the their money supply


---
# Categorization
.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]

- Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions:

  - **Control condition**
  
  - **Recycle condition**
  
  - **Recycle + token condition:** after the participant recycled their matrix worksheet, they told the experimenter their score and the participant gave them tokens, to later exchange for real money

# Categorization
.footnote[Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008)]

.pull-left[
#### Results &amp; discussion (study 3)
- There was a significant difference between all three groups

- This suggests that the addition of token payments increased cheating

# Self-serving justifications

.footnote[Shalvi et al. (2015)]

- A **self-serving justification** is a reason that one provides to attempt to make their unethical behavior less unethical 

- Shalvi et al. (2015) theorize that there are two pathways in which we can avoid a threatened self-concept when we violate a moral norm (pre- and post-violation)


.smallish-centered-picture[![](images/self serving justifications.JPG)]

---

# Self-serving justifications

.footnote[Shalvi et al. (2015)]


**Pre-violation justifications** provide justification to do the act, mainly by making the act a "gray area" where the act is acceptable

**Post-violation justifications** make someone feel that they have atoned for the wrong-doing

#### Distancing 

Comparing ones dishonest behavior to actions that are even more unethical

- We tend towards hypocrisy; we judge our own behavior with different standards than the behavior of others


---
# The moral hypocrite 

.footnote[Valdesolo &amp; DeSteno (2007)]

#### Method

Participants were randomly assigned to a condition.

- **Self**: Participants had to choose between allowing the program to randomly assign you and another participant to an assignment or to choose your assignment. One assignment was 10 minutes and the other was 45 minutes long. The fair thing to do would be to let the computer randomly assign you but nearly all people chose instead to do the 10 minute task. Participants then rated how fairly they had acted.

# The moral hypocrite 

.footnote[Valdesolo &amp; DeSteno (2007)]

#### Method

Participants were randomly assigned to a condition.

- **Unaffiliated other**: Participants judged how fairly someone acted when they chose to do the 10 min task instead of being fair and randomly assigning

- **Ingroup/outgroup other**: Condition 2 but with a ingroup/ outgroup member based on the minimal group paradigm (over estimators/ under-estimators)

# Summary

.smaller[
- A strong motivator of moral behavior is the desire to maintain a positive self-concept

- Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely (2008) proposed that people can cheat without it impacting their self-concept if they fail to **attend to their standards** and if they can **re-categorize** the behavior to seem less dishonest

- Shalvi et al. (2015) theorized that we use pre- and post-violation **self-serving justifications** to avoid threats to our self-concept when we violate our moral standards

- Bandura (1999) proposed eight mechanisms for moral disengagement that one uses to justify the act, refuse to take responsibility, downplay the consequences, and blame the victim
