# Week 1

In the first week, after a review of the syllabus, we will be exploring how philosophers and scientists have understood and measured morality.

.highlight[In week 1:]
- **How will the course be structured?** 
- **How will my learning be assessed? **
- **How has morality been understood and defined?**
- How do scientists measure morality?

# Moral Psychology

Individuals develop variable and sometimes even opposing intuitions about what themselves and others should and should never do. **Moral psychology** is the scientific study of how individuals judge behaviors and character traits as right or wrong/ good or bad, and act (or fail to act) in virtuous ways. In this course, we will explore questions like:

- How do we come to the conclusion that a behavior is wrong?
- How do we judge if someone else is a good or bad person?
- How do we lie, cheat, steal, and hurt others with a clear conscience? 
- Why do different groups of people come to different conclusions about what is right? 
- How do we persuade others to reconsider their stance on moral issues?

---
# Structure of the course

- Week 1-2: background (introduction, measurement, evolution, and development)
- Weeks 3-8: moral thinking (moral reasoning, moral judgments, moral behavior, moral emotions, and the moral self)
- Weeks 9-10: applications of moral psychology (politics, religion, the law)

---
# Assignments

Your course grade will be determined by the following assignments:


```{r, include = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Assignment <- c("Midterm exam", "Final paper", "Quizzes (25 points x4)", "Homework (20 points x4)", "Participation", "")
Points <- c(rep("100 points", 3), "80 points", "20 points", "= 400 points")
grade_table <- cbind(Assignment, Points) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

grade_table %>% kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(c("striped"), position = "left")
```


---

# Assessments  

- The sit-down midterm exam is scheduled for **the sixth week** of the course. The exam will consist of matching, fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, and  short answer questions.

- The final research paper will be due during **finals week**.  You will choose a research question to explore from a list of topics.

---

#Weekly assignments

- Every Sunday, there will be an assignment due on Canvas at **11:59pm**
- The assignments will alternate between quizzes and structured homework assignments

# Discussion guidelines

While studying moral psychology, we are bound to hear from others who do not agree with our moral values. I do not expect to agree with you on everything, and I do not expect you to agree with your classmates on everything. We are a group with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We must therefore make it a priority that everyone in this class have the opportunity to offer their ideas, hear one another’s ideas, and make arguments and challenge ideas. 

If you do not feel comfortable participating in a class discussion or believe there is more that I could be doing to promote a more effective learning environment, I urge you to come talk to me. I will always listen to your concerns with respect and an open mind and will make adjustments when appropriate.


---

# Discussion guidelines

Proposed discussion guidelines:
1. Criticize ideas and not people
2. Avoid making assumptions about others
3. Allow others to make mistakes and learn from them
4. Keep an open mind - don’t assume your beliefs are fully formed and that you can’t learn from others
5. Treat others with respect, even when you disagree

The Good Place is a TV series set in the afterlife. When you die, if you've been a 'good person' you go to the Good Place, and if you've been a 'bad person', you go to the Bad Place. This is a clip from the first episode where the characters are introduced to how their goodness was determined.

# the good place's moral claims

1. All behavior is "good" or "bad"

2. Some actions are more "bad" than others

3. Behavior can be assigned an objective moral score


???
For example, committing genocide gives you -430,000 points, while not tipping a waitress was determined to be only -4 points

# Which actions are "good"?

Let's test these claims. On a piece of paper, order the following actions from right to wrong. Once you're done, compare your rank order with your neighbor(s) and note any disagreements.

  - Donating to a charity.
  - Developing a vaccine.
  - Leaving a restaurant without tipping a waitress.
  - Helping your friend.
  - Eating a chicken sandwich.

???
Our actions may be harmful, even when we have good intentions, so do we determine an action is moral by the intentions of the person, or the consequences? e.g., not all charities ultimately help who they intend to help (charities), or, someone was drugged and then harmed someone

#Defining morality

Definitions of morality are either **descriptive** or **normative**

.footnote[Zalta et al., 2020]
--

- **Normative**: morality is a code of conduct that would be agreed upon by all "rational" persons 

  - Morality is shared beliefs about how we *ought* to act
  - Morality is like it has been defined by writers of The Good Place 
  - Normative theories assume that philosophers can ultimately, through reasoning, determine which behaviors are good and which are bad

---

#Normative definitions of morality

.left-column-big[**Utilitarianism** is the *normative* moral theory that an action is morally right if it .highlight[benefits the most people.]

- Utilitarianism is a <u>consequentialist</u> theory, meaning that it focuses on the consequences of the action.


> "[Morality can be defined as...] the rules and precepts for human conduct, by the observance of which [a happy existence] might be, to the greatest extent possible, secured to all mankind.

.right[-John Stuart Mill, 1861]]

???
John Stuart Mill is a 19th century British philosopher.

#Normative definitions of morality

.left-column-big[**Deontology** is the *normative moral* theory that the determination that an action is right or wrong should depend on .highlight[a set of predetermined rules], rather than on the consequences of the action.

>"A lie always harms another; if not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right."

#A moral dilemma

What *ought* you do in this scenario?

>You are a doctor. You have five patients, each of whom is about to die due to a failing organ of some kind. A new person is rushed into the hospital after a serious car accident. This person is critically injured, and will die without immediate surgery. It is likely you can save
this accident victim, though it would involve long and complicated surgery. You realize that if you purposely cut his
carotid artery during surgery it would cause his death and no
one would ever know. Then you could harvest his organs for
transplant into the bodies of the other five patients. If you do
this, the other five patients will live, but the accident victim
will die. Is it appropriate for you to kill the accident victim
in order to save your five patients? 

.footnote[Aktas et al. (2017)]
---
#Utilitarianism vs. deontology

Utilitarians and deontologists are sometimes in conflict about what they agree is right. For example,

- A utilitarian, who says that we should **increase the utility for the most amount of people**, may argue that the surgeon ought to save the lives of the five by harvesting the organs of the one.

- A deontologist, who relies **on predetermined rules** to decide what is moral, may argue that it is never okay to violate a person's right to life, regardless of the consequences. Thus, there is a predetermined rule that says that we cannot sacrifice a human life for the greater good.

These theories often don't capture how people really think about morality

#Defining morality

Definitions of morality are either **descriptive** or **normative**

- **Normative**: morality is a code of conduct that would be agreed upon by all "rational" persons 
- **Descriptive**: morality is a system of morals that are endorsed by an individual or a group

  - Morality is whatever a group or individual thinks is moral
  - E.g., Catholic morality, Democrat morality, Nazi morality
  
  
.footnote[Zalta et al. (2020)]

# Summary

- Morality refers prescriptively to how we *ought* to behave (normative theories) but also descriptively to behavioral rules that are endorsed by an individual or a group (descriptive theories)
- Philosophers have argued about how we *ought* to reason
  - **Utilitarians** believe the moral act is the one that brings about the best consequences for the most amount of people
  - **Deontologists** believe the moral act is the one that does not violate predetermined rules, like the right that any individual has to life
