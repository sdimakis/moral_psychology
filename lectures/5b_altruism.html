# Altruism and reputation
## Week 5 - Moral Psychology

---


# Week 5
This week, we will be discussing moral behavior, particularly how we are able to suppress  self-interest for the interests of others and of our groups

.highlight-blue[In week 5:]
- What can economic games tell us about how we cooperate with each other?
- How trusting and generous are we towards strangers?
- **Is *genuine* altruism real, or do people always act in self-interest?**
- **Who are our "moral heroes"? How are they special?**

# The missing wallet study
.footnote[Cohn et al. (2019)]
- Cohn et al. (2019) performed a missing wallet experiment in 40 countries with more than 17,000 wallets

- For each wallet, a research assistant walked into a building (banks, theaters, museums, post offices, hotels, police stations, courts of law,or other public offices) and said:

&gt;"Hi, I found this [pointing to the wallet] on the street around the corner. Somebody must have lost it. I’m in a hurry and have to go. Can you please take care of it?”

.left-column-med[- Some wallets had money in them while others had no money
- People were *more* likely to return wallets with money in them
- Across countries, about 40% of no money wallets were returned and about 51% of money wallets were returned]

- Further, when a "big money" condition ($94.15) was added, people were even more likely to return the wallet (see Figure)

- And in another variation, people were about 9% more likely to return wallets with keys

# The missing wallet study
.footnote[Cohn et al. (2019)]

.smallest-picture[![](images/cohn_5.JPG)]
- These findings were contrary to the expectations of expert economists, and contrary to the expectations of non-experts (see Figure)

- Extra monetary incentives *should* decrease wallet returns, but the opposite occurred

- A key, which is valuable to the wallet-owner but not the wallet-finder, should not increase wallet returns, but it does

# The dictator game
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;![](images/dg1.png) &lt;/center&gt;
- The dictator game is a simple variation of the ultimatum game 

- In this game, person A (called the "dictator") is given a sum of money, and they can choose to give a proportion to person B (or to give nothing at all)

- "Dictators" give on average 20% to 30% of the money to the other person

# Altrusim

From these studies, we have learned that people will sometimes act against their self-interest in order to help a stranger

- They will return wallets, especially ones with a lot of money, or ones that hold important valuables like keys

- They will share their rewards with strangers in economic games, even when there is no obvious opportunity for reciprocation

# Altrusim


**Altruistic** behaviors are selfless actions that benefit other(s) without regard to how it will affect oneself


&gt;.highlight-gray[Discussion question:] Think about a recent behavior that you did that was *altruistic*. Would you consider the act **purely** altruistic, or did you benefit from it too?

# Altruism 

Batson and Shaw (1991) describe three pathways to helping, two of which are egotistic (i.e., selfish) and one of which they claim is truly altruistic

1. Reward seeking and punishment avoiding (egoistic)
2. Arousal reducing (egoistic)
3. Empathically evoked (altruistic)


---

# Egoistic motivations for helping

The first reason for helping is **to seek rewards and to avoid punishments**

- For example, helping can be rewarding for an individual because having a cooperative and helpful *reputation* is important 


---


Social reward from a pro-social reputation
To reduce personal distress
Empathetic concern

# Reputation

Study 3-4

.right-column-small[![](images/stress.jpg)]


- Participants took an IAT test

- They were randomly assigned to a low or high implicit racism score 
- Then, they were told that their score would be ranked against others scores and broadcast to the entire school

Study 3-4

.right-column-small[![](images/stress.jpg)]

- They were then told that if they participated in another experiment, their score would not be included in the broadcast
  - The new task was disgusting or painful (worms or ice)

- 62.8% of participants with the (randomly assigned) high racism score were willing to endure a painful ice activity (30.4% put their hand in a bucket of worms)
