# The rationalist model of moral judgment
Last class..

.footnote[Haidt (2001)]
![](images/rationalist_model.JPG)

- Conscious reasoning determines moral judgments  
- Emotions (e.g., sympathy, disgust, anger) are sometimes used as input to guide conscious reasoning

???
In this model, a person is completely rational. In order to make a judgment, individuals reflect and reason through the evidence carefully, thinking about whether the action is fair, whether it harmed anyone, etc.

# Consider the following...
.footnote[Haidt (2012)]
Julie and Mark, who are sister and brother, are traveling together in France. They are both on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At the very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie is already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy it, but they decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to each other. So what do you think about this? .highlight-blue[Was it wrong for them to have sex?]

If you think it was wrong, list a few reasons *why* you think it was wrong.
???
Ask class what were the reasons, pointing out that they used protection, that they were not harmed, that it did not ruin their relationship

# Moral dumbfounding
.footnote[Haidt, Koller, & Dias (1993); Haidt (2001); Haidt (2012)]
.highlight-blue[**Moral dumbfounding**]: An individual makes a moral judgment but cannot defend it with reason; it just *feels* wrong

.right-column-med[![](images/noodles.jpg)]

Haidt demonstrates other instances of "harmless" offenses being moralized

> A family's dog was killed by a car in front of their house. They had heard that dog meat was delicious, so they cut up the dog's body and cooked it and ate it for dinner.

# The rationalist model of moral judgment
.footnote[Haidt (2001)]

![](images/rationalist_model_2.png)

- The rationalist model of moral judgment would conclude that affect alone cannot cause a moral judgment; if someone cannot think of a reason that something is wrong, then it can't be wrong
- However, contrary to this model, with no adequate reasoning, subjects still maintained that the act was wrong
- Haidt (2001) proposed an alternative model of moral judgment called the *social intuitionist model*
???
Affect is merely input for reasoning 
---
# The social intuitionist model
.footnote[Haidt (2001)]

- Moral judgments are caused primarily by quick *intuitions*
- Reasoning has a causal role in moral judgment, but only the reasoning of another person
- Less frequently, individuals can change their intuitions or initial judgment through reasoning

# The social intuitionist model

.footnote[Haidt (2001)]

(1) .highlight-blue[The intuitive-judgment link:] Without any conscious processing, moral judgments occur. <br>
(2) .highlight-gray[The post-hoc-reasoning link:] Once a judgment has occurred, the individual searches for reasons to explain the judgment.

# The social intuitionist model
.footnote[Haidt (2001)]

(3) .highlight-blue[The reasoned-persuasion link:] Moral reasoning can affect the intuitions of others. <br>
(4) .highlight-gray[The social persuasion link:] Judgments can affect the intuitions of others (e.g., conformity).

.smaller-picture[![](images/social_intuitionist_model2.png)]


???
Note that you are not affecting the judgment or reasoning of another person directly, only their intuitions (e.g., emotions)
Core of the model: moral reasoning has a causal role in moral judgment, but only the reasoning of another person. reasoning rarely is used to question or change ones own moral beliefs

# The social intuitionist model
.footnote[Haidt (2001)]

(5) .highlight-blue[The reasoned-judgment link:] The individual overrides their intuition with reasoning. <br>
(6) .highlight-gray[The private reflection link:] An individual, through reasoning, develops a new intuition.

.smaller-picture[![](images/social_intuitionist_model3.png)]


???
*5 occurs rarely, hypothesized only to happen when initial intuition is weak & reasoning skills is high
*6 also occurs rarely, e.g., person perspective takes, feeling sympathy/ other emotional responses

# The social intuitionist model
.footnote[Haidt (2001); Haidt (2012)]
- Moral reasoning is a lawyer not a judge
  - If moral reasoning was like a judge, then we would weigh all of the evidence before the moral judgment
  - Moral reasoning is instead like a lawyer; it's purpose is to justify the judgment, searching after the judgment for reasons to support it and convince others to support it
  .right-column-med[![](images/elephant-rider.jpg)]

- The mind is like a rider on an elephant 
  - The rider is our conscious processing 
  - The elephant is our automatic, unconscious processing  
  
???
The rider can: develop goals and think about and weigh future consequences... it also speaks for the elephant, even when it doesn't know why the elephant does what the elephant does

# Evidence for motivated reasoning 
.footnote[Uhlmann et al. (2009)]

Pretest

Researchers gave participants the following set of instructions:

> There are certain factors that come into play that may make it OK to harm others in certain situations. For example, some people believe that harming other people is usually wrong, but if someone is guilty of a serious crime (such as murder) then this should be taken into account when deciding to harm (such as giving
the death penalty). We are interested in finding out if the following facts should reasonably influence a personâ€™s moral judgment in deciding whether to harm others in order to promote greater consequences.

# Critisims of the social intuitionist model

1. Deciding vs. reacting

- Divergent models represent two 
  - Shocking moral violations (intuitionist model)
  - Complex moral dilemmas (rationalist or dual-process model)
