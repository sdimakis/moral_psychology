# Week 2

This week we will be discussing moral insights from research on animals and human infants and children

.highlight-blue[In week 2:]
- How can natural selection, which touts "survival of the fittest," account for the evolution of moral organisms?
- Are pieces of our moral intuitions present in nonhuman animals?
- **Are children capable of moral reasoning and moral behavior?**
- **How do we develop moral judgments across the lifespan?**

---
# Moral development

Part 1. Research on infants 
- Is morality innate? Are infants capable of moral behavior?

Part 2. Theories of moral development
1. Kohlberg's stage theory 
2. Social domain theory

#Infant research
.footnote[Warneken & Tomasello (2006)]
- Warneken & Tomasello (2006) presented 18-month-old infants with different situations from four categories

#Infant research
.footnote[Warneken & Tomasello (2006)]
- In the experimental condition, the experimenter would alternate his gaze between the child and the object and then verbalize his problem (e.g., "my marker!")
- In the control condition, the experimenter would look at the object with a neutral face for 20 seconds
- The child did not receive any praise or reward for helping
- The child was presented with 5 control trials and 5 experimental trials, and the experimenter recorded how many times the child helped

For most tasks, the infants were more likely to help in the experimental conditions than in the control conditions

#Infant research
.footnote[Warneken & Tomasello (2006)]

This research finding implies that these pre-verbal infants were able to distinguish between when a stranger needed help vs. didn't need help AND that they were motivated to help them 

.highlight-blue[Discussion question]: How (if at all) do these findings differ from what we discussed about the altruistic behavior in chimpanzees and other primates?

# Infant research
.footnote[Hamlin et al. (2007)]

- Hamlin et al. (2007) showed infants (5 to 10 months old) live shows with animated, wooden shapes
- In the show, a red circle would be attempting to climb a hill
- In some shows, another character would enter the scene and interact with the climber
- For example, the yellow triangle (left) helps the red circle up the hill, while the blue square (right) pushes the red circle down the hill

# Infant research
.footnote[Hamlin et al. (2007)]
Study 1
- Infants watched the helping show and hindering show back to back until they became disinterested (no longer looking at the show, suggesting that they had fully processed it)
- Infants were then asked to choose which toy they would like to play with - the yellow triangle (the helper) or the blue square (the hinderer)
- Researchers recorded which toy the infant reached for first
- 12/12 6-month-olds and 14/16 10-month-olds reached for the helper 


---
# Infant research
.footnote[Hamlin et al. (2007)]
Study 2
- Researchers wanted to know if infants choose the yellow 
triangle because it was helpful, or because of other intrinsic properties (e.g., because they preferred objects moving uphill, are yellow, or are triangles)
- They designed a second experiment where the only change was that the triangle was pushing a red ball (no eyes) up a hill and the blue square was pushing a red ball down the hill

# Infant research
.footnote[Hamlin et al. (2007)]
.right-column-med[![](images/bloomwynn2.png)]
- The researchers found that when the object being pushed up or down the hill was a ball, then the infants did not prefer the yellow triangle over the blue square
- This suggests that infants preferred the yellow triangle in study 1 because they have already (at 6 months) developed a preference for good over bad characters
--

- .highlight-blue[Discussion question]: Do these studies prove that knowing the difference between good and bad actions are innate?

# Lawrence Kohlberg
.footnote[Kohlberg, 1968]
Kohlberg conducted a 12 year longitudinal study, presenting the same moral dilemmas to boys at different time points in their lives, from childhood to early adulthood 

For example, he asked his participants:

>"Should the doctor mercy kill a fatally ill woman requesting death because of her pain?"
---

# Richard's responses to the mercy killing dilemma

Age 13: "If she requests it, it's really up to her. She is in such terrible pain, just the same as people are always putting animals out of their pain."

Age 16: "I don't know. In one way, it's murder, it's not a right or privilege of man to decide who shall live and who should die. God put life into everybody on earth and you're taking away something from that person that came directly from God, and you're destroying something that is very sacred..."

Age 24: "A human life takes precedence over any other moral or legal value, whoever it is. A human life has inherent value whether or not it is valued by a particular individual. The worth of the individual human being is central where the principles of justice and love are normative for all human relationships."

#  Kohlberg's stage theory
.footnote[Kohlberg, 1968]

- **Pre-conventional level**: right and wrong is determined through rewards and punishments
- **Conventional level**: right and wrong is determined by expectations and rules from family, group, and/or nation
- **Post-conventional level**: right and wrong is determined by autonomous, abstract moral principles

???
Pre-conventional (children): the individual is concerned with themself only; something is wrong when they get punished for it; something is right when they get rewarded for it. They are not considering others or society

Conventional (adolescents and most adults): the individual is concerned with what others think; they are concerned with laws but not just because they are avoiding punishment but because they are motivated to maintain social order

Post-conventional (some adults): Most adults never reason at this level; you reason like a philosopher 

---
# Kohlberg's stage theory
.footnote[Kohlberg, 1968]

![](images/kohlberg_stages.JPG)
???
Stage 1: e.g., a child avoids a behavior because they were punished for it
Stage 2: e.g., a child helping clean because they were offered ice cream
Stage 3: e.g., they want to be "good" because they want others to like them 
Stage 4: laws should not be broken, e.g., you should not steal because it is against the law and the law is important or else there would not be chaos
Stage 5: focused on individual rights; e.g., you can steal if your family is starving because people should have the right to life, to not suffer
Stage 6: like a philosopher; e.g., the golden rule (treat others like you want to be treated); the categorical imperative; Kant's categorical imperative  (act only in a way in which you would want the act to become universal law)
--

.highlight-blue[Q]: Which stage do you think primates reason at? What about psychopaths?

# A criticism of Kohlberg's theory

Kohlberg's stage theory implies that adults who do not reason at the post-conventional level are morally deficient 

  - Some cultures do not have adults at level 3 (Gibbs et al., 2007) because level 3 reasoning relies on individual rights which are de-emphasized in some cultures (e.g., collectivistic cultures)
  - Kohlberg used this model to claim that women have inferior moral reasoning abilities; some (e.g., Kohlberg's student Carol Gilligan (1982)) have argued that women reason differently, focusing more on interpersonal relationships than individual rights

???
  - The theory was developed on a very WEIRD sample (western, white, upper-class boys)
  - This theory is surprisingly secular. It assumes that religion plays no role in moral development

# Social domain theory
.footnote[Turiel (1983)]

Elliot Turiel developed social domain theory in the late 70s and early 80s.

- **Social domain theory**: moral development is driven by a child's interactions with their social environment 
  + Children learn rules from their social interactions about how they should act in social situations
  + They learn rules that can be categorized into three different social domains 
  + The social domains develop in parallel and follow different developmental trajectories
  
???
That they develop in parallel is distinct from Kohleberg, who theorized that morality develops in stages
  
  
---
# SDT: the three social domains
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]
- The three social domains:
  - **Psychological domain**: private personal preferences that do not violate the rights or welfare of others
  - **Societal domain**: normative rules about tradition, authority, and social norms and convention that coordinate social interactions
  -  **Moral domain**: prescriptive judgments about justice, welfare, and rights

  
---
# SDT: the moral domain
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]

Rules in **the moral domain** are obligatory, universally acceptable, and not determined through consensus/ institutional convention

- A moral transgression is wrong because of intrinsic features of the act (e.g., it is harmful), not because an institution says so 

For example, a child learns that hitting is wrong. Hitting is wrong even if an authority figure or institution says its OK because hitting harms others. 

---
#SDT: the societal domain
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]

Social conventions are shared across a group of people and they determine which behaviors are appropriate for a given context (e.g., etiquette)
- Social conventions are arbitrary; another social convention could be substituted to fill the same role

E.g., a child learns that they need to wear their uniform to school (a blue shirt and black pants). This rule is arbitrary because a purple shirt could be substituted and the purpose of the uniform is fulfilled; there is no reason that the shirt needs to be blue   

---
#SDT: the psychological domain
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]

Personal issues are distinct from social conventions because they occur in private or only concern an individual; personal issues are distinct from moral rules because they do not violate the rights or welfare of others

E.g., a child learns that they (and others) have different food preferences and that everyone has the freedom to choose what to eat based on those preferences

---
#SDT: moral vs. societal domains
.footnote[Turiel (1983); Smetana (2014)]

- Children construct the moral domain through empathy and through observing negative consequences when the rule is violated
  - In social interactions, a child observes (either because they are a victim or an observer) that immoral actions uniquely cause emotional distress to a victim 
  - These actions are then assigned moral status, whereas interactions that do not lead to emotional distress are not

- Simultaneously, children are also constructing the societal domain by witnessing the arbitrary rules and expectations in their given culture
  - When a convention is violated, there is rarely emotional distress/ a victim

???
Children learn that moral rules exist due to intrinsic features of the act, while social conventions exist to maintain social order. Conventions are arbitrary; another rule could fit the purpose just as well 
Example: Wearing red vs. wearing black to a funeral

---
#Evidence for Social domain theory
.footnote[Smetana (1981)]
Children aged 2-9 rated 10 moral and conventional social rules on how serious the rule is, how much a person should be punished for breaking the rule, and how permissible the rule would be in the absence of a rule 

1. One child hitting another child. (M)
2. A child not sharing a toy. (M)
3. A child shoving another child. (M)
4. A child throwing water at another child. (M)
5. A child taking another child's apple. (M)
6. A child not participating in show and tell. (C)
7. A child not sitting in the designated place (on the rug) during story time.(C) 
8. A child not saying grace before snack. (C)
9. A child putting a toy away in the incorrect place. (C)
10. A child not placing her belongings in the designated place. (C)

???
This is just an example of a study that supports this theory
---
#Evidence for Social domain theory
.footnote[Smetana (1981)]
- Moral transgressions were rated as more serious and deserving of stricter punishment than conventional transgressions
- Conventional transgressions were rated as more permissible in the absence of a rule than moral transgressions
  - The harm transgressions (hitting, shoving, and throwing water) were rated not permissible by everyone, while the fairness transgression (stealing an apple) was only rated as not permissible by older kids

This is evidence that children (even very young children) distinguish between and treat moral rules and social conventions differently
---



# A criticism of social domain theory

- The moral/ conventional distinction is not always pronounced
  - Many non-Western cultures treat acts as moral that Westerners would call social conventions
  - An act may be considered moral in one context but a convention in another (e.g., an act was considered moral historically but now is not)

E.g., some people think that kneeling for a flag is a violation of a social convention, while others think that it is a moral violation. This theory is unable to answer exactly how this disagreement develops
---

# Summary

- Infants as early as 6 months old reliably prefer to play with nice toys over mean toys
- Infants as early as 18 months are willing to help strangers, even though they are not personally benefiting 
- Kohlberg theorized that morality developed in stages    
  - The final stage (that most adults never reach) is to make moral judgments through consistent abstract principles rather than because of rewards or punishment, obeying authority, and/or societal pressures
- Turiel theorized that children construct the moral domain through social interactions
  - Crucial to constructing the moral domain is learning to distinguish moral rules (which are invariable/ exist because of intrinsic properties of the act itself) and social conventions (which are arbitrary and fluid)
