# Moral emotions

.footnote[Haidt (2003)]

**Moral emotions** are emotions felt in response to a moral event

  - Feeling angry at injustice
  - Feeling guilty for hurting your friend
  - Feeling grateful for an act of kindness 

The most prototypical moral emotions have two prominent features: **disinterested elicitors** and **pro-social action tendencies**

---

# Disinterested elicitors

.footnote[Haidt (2003)]

.pull-left[
####Emotions
Typically, an emotion is elicited in a situation when something good or bad happens to the self

  - I am **happy** that I did well on the test
  
  - I am **afraid** that I will fall and hurt myself]

.pull-right[
####Moral emotions
Moral emotions are often triggered by events that are not happening to the self

  - I am **angry** that the Tesla driving woman left her dog
  
  - I am feeling **guilty** for hurting my friend]
---

# Pro-social action tendencies

.footnote[Haidt (2003)]


.pull-left[####Emotions
Emotions motivate us to act 

  - E.g., I am **afraid**, so I am going to run away
  
  - E.g., I am **disgusted**, so I am going to throw the moldy food away]
  
.pull-right[####Moral emotions
Moral emotions motivate us to act *pro-socially*

  - I am feeling **compassion**, so I will donate
  
  - I am feeling **guilty**, so I will apologize for my actions]

.pull-left[
####Elicitors

]

# Other-condemning family: contempt
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
.pull-left[

# Self-conscious family
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
Self-conscious emotions are felt when we ourselves violate a moral or social norm. Self-conscious emotions allow us to to cooperate in groups without triggering the anger, disgust, and contempt of others

- Shame

- Embarrassment

- Guilt 

???

Shame and embarrassment are not seen as different emotions in some cultures (e.g., cultures with interdependent construal of the self)

---

# Self-conscious family: shame
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
.pull-left[
####Elicitors

- In western cultures, shame is most often triggered when one violates a norm and at least one person knows about the violation

- When someone feels shame, they appraise that their action(s) reveal that they have a flawed and defective *self*
]
--

.pull-right[
####Action tendencies
- Shame motivates people to hide and withdraw from society 

- The urge to withdraw is dark and painful 
]


???

- In a cultures with strong social hierarchies, one can feel shame just by being in the presence of people who are ranked higher

The opposite of shame is pride

---

# Self-conscious family: embarrassment
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
.pull-left[
####Elicitors
- In western cultures, embarrassment is also most often triggered when someone violates a norm 

- However, when someone feels embarrassed rather than ashamed, they appraise that their action(s) reveal something negative about their person in this particular situation
 
]

--

.pull-right[
####Action tendencies

- Embarrassment also motivates one to hide, but the urge to withdraw is less dark and painful

- One might want to cover their face or leave the interaction, but not to withdraw completely from society 
]

???

Question: Which emotion would be more common in internalizing mental health disorders, like depression?

---

# Self-conscious family: guilt
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
.pull-left[
####Elicitors
- Guilt is elicited in situations where one believes  they have harmed a relationship partner or otherwise caused them distress

- It is most intensely triggered when the harm was so severe that it has threatened the relationship
]

--

.pull-right[
####Action tendencies
- Guilt motivates one to help the victim, apologize, confess, or to do something that will make up for the action 
]

???
Guilt can be triggered by strangers but is most commonly triggered by those we are close to 

One is appraising their actions as bad (not their self, like with shame)

---

# Other-suffering family
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
Other-suffering emotions are felt when we witness the suffering of others. Other-suffering emotions motivate us to help those who are suffering

- Compassion


---

# Other-suffering family: compassion
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
.pull-left[
####Elicitors
- Compassion is elicited when one believes that another is suffering 
]

--

.pull-right[
####Action tendencies
- Compassion motives one to alleviate the suffering of the person in distress, usually through helping or comforting 
]


---
# Other-praising family
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
Other-praising emotions are felt when we observe someone doing a good deed. Other-praising emotions motivate us to act more moral ourselves

- Gratitude

- Elevation 

---

# Other-praising family

####Broaden-and-build hypothesis


Fredrickson (1998)

---

# Other-praising family: gratitude
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
.pull-left[
####Elicitors
- Gratitude is elicited when someone believes that another person has intentionally and voluntarily done a good deed for them 
]

--

.pull-right[
####Action tendencies
- Gratitude motivates one to thank the other person and to try to return the favor to them
]

---

# Other-praising family: elevation
.footnote[Haidt (2003)]
.pull-left[
####Elicitors
- Elevation is elicited when someone sees or hears a story about a tremendous act of kindness

- It feels warm and expansive, similar to the experience of "awe"
]

--

.pull-right[
####Action tendencies

- Elevation motivates one act more pro-socially, and not just toward the person who does the act; it causes one to want to *be a better person* in all situations 

]

---

# Other moral emotions?

#### Could these be considered moral emotions?

- Fear

- Schadenfreude

- Empathy 

- Warm glow

???

Fear may cause more law-abiding behavior in certain situations but it is a self interested emotion 

Schadenfreude (joy at another's misfortune) does not appear to motivate pro-social action

Empathy is not considered an emotion - broadly, it's to feel what another person is feeling  

Warm glow is the feeling of joy when you help others
