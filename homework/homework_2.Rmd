***Instructions***: For this homework assignment, you are going to read a recent paper that found that hypothetical decision making in a trolley dilemma did not match actual decision making in a trolley dilemma. Please upload your homework to Canvas by 11:59pm on Sunday.

1. Read [this](extra/Bostyn_2018.pdf) paper by Bostyn, Sevenhant, & Roets (2018). Write a short paragraph summarizing their findings.

2. Choose **ONE** of the following critiques of the Bostyn et al. (2018) paper. Write 1-2 sentences summarizing their argument.

    - Overlooked Evidence and a Misunderstanding of What Trolley Dilemmas Do Best [Plunkett & Greene (2019)](extra/Plunkett_2019.pdf)
  
    - What Is the Right Question for Moral Psychology to Answer? [Bia≈Çek, Turpin, & Fugelsang (2019)](extra/Bialek_2019.pdf)
  
    - Comparing Hypothetical and Real-Life Trolley Problems [Colman, Gold, & Pulford (2019)](extra/Colman_2019.pdf)
  
    - Comparing the Effects of Hypothetical Moral Preferences on Real-Life and Hypothetical Behavior [Evans & Brandt (2019)](extra/Evans_2019.pdf)
  
3. Read the section in [this](extra/Bostyn_2019.pdf) follow up paper by Bostyn and Roets (2019) that addresses the commentary that you read. Write 1-2 sentences summarizing Bostyn and Roets's rebuttal. 

4. Finally, answer the following questions:

    - What were your initial thoughts on the Bostyn, Sevenhant, & Roets (2018) paper? Were you surprised by their findings? Do you think that hypothetical moral dilemmas are pointless to study if they cannot strongly predict actual behavior?
  
    - Do you agree or disagree with the criticism posed in the commentary? Why or why not? 
  
    - Do you think that the follow up Bostyn & Roets (2019) adequately addressed the criticism? Why or why not?
