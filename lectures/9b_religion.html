# Religion and morality
## Week 9 - Moral Psychology

---


# Week 9

This week, we will be discussing religious and otherwise moral convictions and sacred values.

.highlight-blue[In week 9:]

- What qualifies as a moral conviction or a sacred value?
- How does an attitude become a moral imperative, rather than just a convention or preference?
- **Do people perceive atheists as less moral than theists?**
- **Does religion make us behave more morally?**

# Religion
.footnote[Bloom (2012)]

Bloom (2012) argues that there are three ways to define religion

* Religion requires transcendent or mystical experience (e.g., the feeling of "awe", the experience of a religious vision)

* Religion requires supernatural beliefs (e.g.,  the belief in God or angels)

* Religion requires one to participate in religious social activities (e.g., going to religious service with others)

???

One can experience one of these without the other, e.g., being spiritual without affiliating with a specific religion, or going to services but not believing in God in the literal sense

We will mostly be talking about a belief in God, and a little bit about the social aspect of religion

i.e., if you give a description of an immoral act, do people make a conjunction error because they think that immoral acts are representative of atheists?

**Incest scenario**

&gt; .smaller[Graeme and his sister were traveling together in France. One night they
were staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decided that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Graemeâ€™s sister was already taking
birth control pills, but Graeme used a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoyed it, but they decided not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to
each other.]

pick up something for dinner. He decided to roast a whole chicken. He
got home, unwrapped the chicken carcass, and decided to make love to it.
He used a condom, and fully sterilized the carcass when he was
finished. He then roasted the chicken and ate it for dinner alongside a
nice glass of Chardonnay.]

#### Discussion

1. Why do you think people perceive atheists so negatively?

2. Do you think atheists are more likely to commit crimes than theists? Do you think that theists are more charitable than atheists?

# Theism and prosociality 

#### Why are theists perceived as more moral than atheists?

**One possibility:** people think that theists are more moral because theists believe in a deity that is/deities that are monitoring their behavior and in some cases are threatening eternal punishment for immoral behavior

# Theism and prosociality

**Research question:** Do people act more pro-socially when they have been reminded that God is watching them?

- Participants participated in the dictator game

# Theism and prosociality
.footnote[Shariff &amp; Norenzayan (2011)]

#### Method

- Participants participated in a math task for money that measured cheating behavior
- Before the task, the participants read a message that said that if they didn't press the space bar when they first see the question, the answer will show up on the screen
  - They were told that this is a glitch and to not take advantage 
- The researchers measured how many times participants did not press the space bar (cheating)

# Theism and prosociality
.footnote[Shariff &amp; Norenzayan (2011)]

#### Method


After the task, participants filled out a *Views of God scale*

&gt; How much does each trait apply to your conception of God or Gods? If you are non-believer, how much do you feel that each trait applies to your culture's conception of God or Gods?
- **Positive traits**: forgiving, loving, compassionate, gentle, kind, comforting, and peaceful
- **Negative traits**: vengeful, harsh, fearsome, angry, punishing, jealous, and terrifying

???

7-point Likert scale

# Theism and prosociality
.footnote[Shariff &amp; Norenzayan (2011)]
.smallest-picture[![](images/mean god.JPG)]
#### Results

- People who think of God as *forgiving* and *loving* were more likely to cheat

- People who think of God as *vengeful* and *punishing* were less likely to cheat
---
# Theism and prosociality

#### Discussion questions

1. Why do you think secular primes are just as effective as religious primes in increasing pro-social behavior? 

2. If thinking of God as a forgiving and loving deity does not increase moral behavior, why have people evolved to think of God in this way?

---
# Theism and prosociality 

#### Why are theists perceived as more moral than atheists?

**One possibility:** people think that theists are more moral because theists believe in a deity that is/deities that are monitoring their behavior and in some cases are threatening eternal punishment for immoral behavior

.highlight-gray[**An alternate explanation:** in a community where the majority attend religious services, those who do not are considered morally abnormal outcasts]

# Theism and prosociality
.footnote[Graham &amp; Haidt (2010); Bloom (2012); Putnam &amp; Campbell (2010);  Brooks (2006)]

- **Research question:** Are people who attend religious services more prosocial than those who do not?

--

  - Religious people give more money to charities than atheists do, even charities that are not religiously affiliated 

  - However, what is associated with giving money to charities is not the strength of one's beliefs but **how often one attends religious service** 


---

# Theism and prosociality
.footnote[Graham &amp; Haidt (2010)]

&gt; "In fact, the statistics suggest that even an atheist
who happened to become involved in the social life of the congregation (perhaps through
a spouse) is much more likely to volunteer in
a soup kitchen than the most fervent believer
who prays alone. It is religious belongingness
that matters for neighborliness, not religious
believing. " 
.right[-Putnam &amp; Campbell (2010)]

---

# Theism and prosociality
.footnote[Graham &amp; Haidt (2010); Bloom (2012)]

- Being apart of a community that values charity and selflessness increases one's own pro-social behavior (regardless of whether or not they actually hold supernatural beliefs)

- People who have strong social ties with their community  want to volunteer and give to their community 

???

Participating in a bowling league also happened to increase charitable donations (Putnam, 2000)

" To belong to
a religion is to belong to a social group whose
members are close to one another, who share
rituals and meet regularly, and hence are more
likely to be generous toward each other and
less likely to cheat one anotherâ€”and, under
some circumstances, are more likely to be nasty
toward others." Bloom (2012)

- **Parochial altruism** is the act of sacrificing oneself for one's ingroup (e.g., suicide bombing)

- Participants were given the following two statements to assess parochial attitudes 

&gt;1. I would be willing to die for my
God/beliefs
2. I blame people of other religions for much of the trouble in this world

- Participants also answered whether or not they prayed frequently and whether or not they regularly attend organized religious service ]

???

Those who replied "yes" to both of the following items were considered to have parochial attitudes 

They looked at Indonesian Muslims, Mexican Catholics, British Protestants, Russian Orthodox in Russia, Israeli Jews, and Indian Hindus (these are the dominant religions in their respective countries)

# Summary

- People view atheists as worse than theists on a number of dimensions
  - The prototypical theist is rated as more moral, trustworthy,  competent, warm, gentle, likable, happy, and hardworking than the prototypical atheist 
- Beliefs in God can increase prosociality, especially for someone who thinks that God is vengeful and punishing
- However, secular honor codes and primes about the legal system increase moral behavior just as well
- Theism tends to be associated with increased prosociality only *within* one's own community
