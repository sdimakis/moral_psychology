# Week 10
This week, we will be discussing how understanding studying morality can inform political disagreement and bridge divides.

.highlight-blue[In week 10:]

- **Why do conservatives and liberals disagree on so many moral issues?**
- What is similar about the moral minds of liberals and conservatives?
- Is it possible to compromise on political issues?

# Activity

.pull-left[<br>
**Instructions**: For each issue on the right, consider the following: 

1. In the US, where do liberals and conservatives typically stand on the issue?

2. Are the stances *moral* ones on both sides? 

After you're done...

3. What unites these platforms?

#Four perspectives

Today, we are going to talk about four perspectives on why liberals and conservatives tend to take opposing stances on moral issues

- Moral intuitions 
 
- Moral motives 

- Moral metaphors 

- Moral circles 
---

# Moral intuitions
.footnote[Haidt & Joseph (2007); Koleva et al. (2012)]

**Moral foundations theory** posits that there are (at least) six moral intuitions
.smaller[- **Harm/care** - We should care for and not harm vulnerable others.
- **Fairness/cheating** - We should get back what we put forward; we should not cheat.
- **Ingroup/ betrayal** - We should be loyal to our groups (e.g., family, nation).
- **Authority/ subversion** - We should respect authority and tradition.
- **Purity/ Degradation** - We should not violate norms of decency and purity by doing certain things with our bodies.
- **Liberty/ Oppression** - People should not restrict the freedom of others.

# Moral intuitions
#### The moral foundations questionaire
.footnote[Graham, Haidt, & Nosek (2009)]
When you decide whether something is right or wrong, to what extent are the following considerations relevant to your thinking? 1 = not at all relevant TO 5 = extremely relevant 

.smaller[
1. Whether or not someone suffered emotionally. (Care)<br>
2. Whether or not someone acted unfairly. (Fairness)<br>
3. Whether or not someone did something to betray his or her group. (Ingroup)<br>
4. Whether or not someone showed a lack of respect for authority. (Authority)<br>
5. Whether or not someone violated standards of purity and decency. (Purity)

####Moral trade-offs

> Try to imagine actually doing the following things, and indicate how
much money someone would have to pay you (anonymously and
secretly) to be willing to do each thing. For each action, assume that
nothing bad would happen to you afterwards. Also assume that you
cannot use the money to make up for your action.

**Options**: $0 (I’d do it for free), $10, $100, $1,000, $10,000, $100,000, a million dollars, and
never for any amount of money.

# Disgust sensitivity

*Please indicate how much you agree with each of the following statements, or how true it is about you.*

1. I might be willing to try eating monkey meat, under some circumstances.

2. If I see someone vomit, it makes me sick to my stomach.

3. Seeing a cockroach in someone else’s house does not bother me. (Reverse coded)

4. Even if I was hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my favourite soup if it had been stirred by
a used but thoroughly washed fly swatter.

*How disgusting would you find each of the following experiences?*

5. You see maggots on a piece of meat in an outdoor garbage pail.

6. While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track, you smell urine.

7. A friend offers you a piece of chocolate shaped like dog-doo.

####Discussion questions

1. These results suggest that conservatives are hypersensitive to disgust. Why do you think conservatives tend to be more disgust sensitive? Do you think that it is innate or learned?

2. Why do you think conservatives might moralize authority and loyalty more than liberals? 

???

City living vs. rural living? Political ideology/ moral values tends to be inherited. 

Religion?

# Moral motives

#### The Model of Moral Motives
.smaller[
- All moral motives can be classified by the two **motivational systems** (approach or avoid) and the **focus of moral concern** (the self, another person, or the group)

  - **Motivational systems**: our approach motivational system designates moral beliefs about what we *ought to do* (called prescriptive morality) and our avoidance motivational system designates moral beliefs about what we *ought not to do* (called proscriptive morality)
  
  - **Focus of moral concern**: we have moral beliefs concerning what is virtuous for the self, for another person, and for the group]

1. It’s particularly important to me to demonstrate self-control in
the face of temptation.

2. We should all be responsible for improving the welfare of others
beyond our immediate circle of friends and family.

3. Giving people the freedom to choose the way they live threatens
the societal bonds that hold us together.

4. I’m willing to put the necessary time and effort into providing
for my own well-being and success.

5. It’s an obligation, not a matter of personal preference, to provide for people worse off even if we're not close to them.

# Moral metaphors
.footnote[Lakoff (2016)]

We tend to think and talk in metaphor

- E.g., when we think about fairness, we use an accounting metaphor:
  - If you do me a favor, I "owe" you one
  - If I hurt you, I need to respond with an equally positive good act to make up for it
- E.g., to talk about moral behavior, we use a standing metaphor:
  - "They are an upstanding citizen"
  - "He went low"
  - "She fell from grace"

#Summary

.smallish[
- Moral foundations theory says that liberals have more moral concerns related to individualizing (care and fairness) and conservatives have more moral concerns related to binding foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity)

- The moral model of motives argues that rather than a individualizing-binding distinction, conservatives have an innate preference for proscriptive moral regulation (i.e., what to avoid) while liberals for prescriptive moral regulation (i.e., what to approach)

- Differing parental models affect how an individual thinks a government should be run; conservatives think the government should act like a strict father, while liberals think the government should act like a nurturant parent 

- Conservatives have more parochial moral concerns, while liberals have more universalist moral concerns]
