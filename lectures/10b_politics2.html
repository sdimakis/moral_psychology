# Political polarization and persuasion
## Week 10 - Moral Psychology

---



# Week 10
This week, we will be discussing how understanding studying morality can inform political disagreement and bridge divides

.highlight-gray[In week 10:]

- Why do conservatives and liberals disagree on so many moral issues?

- **What is similar about the moral minds of liberals and conservatives?**

- **Is it possible to compromise on political issues?** 


---
# The group polarization effect
.footnote[Sunstein, Hastie, &amp; Schkade (2007)]
#### Method

- Researchers collected two samples

  - Boulder, CO - mostly liberal
  
  - Colorado Springs, CO - mostly conservative

- Participants first privately reported their views on three political topics

#### Method

.smaller-picture[![](images/10 point rating scale.JPG)]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

1. The United States should sign an international agreement to reduce the greenhouse gases produced in this country that contribute to global warming.

2. When different applicants for the same job or educational opportunity are almost equal on relevant criteria, then the job or admission shuold be given to members of groups in society that have been discriminated against in the past.

3. Two adults of the same sex should be able to form a "civil union," which would entitle them to certain legal rights such as joint home ownership, or access to the other's retirement or medical benefits.

# The group polarization effect
.footnote[Sunstein, Hastie, &amp; Schkade (2007)]

#### Method

- Participants next met with their group and each person explained their own personal opinions, trying to convince others that they should move closer to their opinion

- The groups were relatively homogeneous; everyone held very similar views on each topic

- After the discussion was over, participants privately rated their opinions again

# The group polarization effect


Group discussion among people with similar views tends to lead to a more extreme position by group members


.highlight-gray[Discussion question:] Why do you think this is the case?

???
Possible answers -
  * Discussion exposes us to more arguments supporting the issue 

  * Shift in comparison group (you are above average at X, new comparison group but need to remain above average)
  
  * People like you believe this
  
  * You feel more certain that you are right because of consensus

# Political polarization

#### Summary 
- There are two "Americas" who do not fundamentally understand each other and do not want to hear from each other

- Each group has strong, opposing moral convictions

  - They believe that their beliefs should be universal
  
  - They are intolerant of the other group and unwilling to compromise
  
  - Their beliefs are independent of peers and the law
  
  - They believe that the ends justify the means

--

- There are big problems that we need to work on together (e.g., climate change, healthcare, immigration, diseases like COVID19...)

--

&lt;center&gt; *How do we fix this?*

# Political polarization

#### Possible ways to increase moral understanding
- Moral reframing

- The theory of dyadic morality

- Personal experiences

# Moral reframing

#### Discussion question

&gt; Moral reframing appears to be pretty successful in getting individuals to agree on political issues. Why do you think it is rarely used by politicians?

???

- They may not realize it will work
- It might feel unethical or inauthentic
- They don't know how to, e.g., they may not understand the morals of the other side
- It may feel like betrayal to your group to talk in someone else's morals

# The theory of dyadic morality

.footnote[Gray, Waytz, &amp; Young (2012)]
&lt;center&gt;![](images/gray_dyad.JPG)

Acts that cause harm to a defenseless victim are the prototypical moral violation, the most accessible moral violation
---
# The theory of dyadic morality

.footnote[Gray, Waytz, &amp; Young (2012)]
&lt;center&gt;![](images/gray2.JPG)

This causes agent/patient to become a cognitive template for a moral violation

---
# The theory of dyadic morality

.footnote[Gray, Waytz, &amp; Young (2012)]
&lt;center&gt;![](images/gray3.JPG) &lt;/center&gt;
The immoral agent/patient cognitive template can sometimes lead individuals to perceive a victim that others do not see


---
# The theory of dyadic morality
.footnote[Schein &amp; Gray (2015)]
- Liberals and conservatives do not have different moral minds (like MFT suggests); they share a harm-based template of morality

  - When a person perceives an agent harming a victim, they condemn the act
  
  - The disagreements lie in if harm is occurring
  
---

# The theory of dyadic morality

&gt; **Instructions**: List an act that is morally wrong. Write down whatever comes to your mind first.

# The theory of dyadic morality
.footnote[Schein &amp; Gray (2015)]

#### Conclusions
- There are no underlying cognitive differences between conservatives and liberals; instead, there are differences in beliefs about what causes harm

  - Atheists may not believe that purity violations are immoral because they may not believe that one has a soul to be damaged

  - Those who support drastic environmental reform may not see the harm it will cause certain individuals in rural areas (e.g., job loss)

# The theory of dyadic morality
.footnote[Schein &amp; Gray (2015)]

#### Conclusions

&gt; *" If people all 
speak the same moral “language” of harm, 
we should be able to translate moral issues across partisan 
divides. More specifically, by granting legitimacy to our 
political opponent’s perceptions of harm, we may be more 
accepting of their views and more willing to engage in 
discussion." *

**Instructions**: For these issues, think of how these differences may be caused by differences in beliefs what causes harm/ who the victim is

# Personal experiences
.footnote[Kubin et al. (2021)]

#### Respect as a goal of moral understanding

- Working together to solve big problems requires more than just an ability to persuade each other, or a method for finding common ground 

- Instead of persuasion, a goal may be to *respect* each other's moral differences

.pull-left[Free response question: "Imagine someone disagrees

- Individuals believe that facts and evidence would garner respect

- They are wrong...

# Personal experiences
.footnote[Kubin et al. (2021)]

.pull-left[#### Personal experience and respect

- Gave participants either a real world gun-related personal experience or a real gun policy statistic (e.g., "murder rates were
19.3% higher when the Federal assault weapon ban was in effect") to justify a position

- Providing a personal experience fostered more respect than giving facts, even when the personal experience was low in harm]

.pull-right[![](images/moral understanding respect 2.JPG)]

???
Also, people were more willing to interact with people who gave a high harm personal experience as a reason for their position, over someone who gave facts

# Personal experiences
.footnote[Kubin et al. (2021)]

.pull-left[#### Personal experience and perceived truth
- For moral matters, individuals did not trust facts when they disagreed with their moral values, *but they did trust experiences that disagreed with their moral values*

- Because people doubt facts that support a different moral position than theirs, facts do not lead to respect

# Summary

- Talking with people who hold similar values to our own make our values more extreme

- The increased availability of spaces to share our moral values (e.g., through social media) has contributed to political polarization in America

- There are a few ways we may be able to better understand and work with people who have moralities that are different from our own

  - Moral reframing allows us to persuade others of our position, even when they have different moral intuitions
  
  - The theory of dyadic morality suggests that we may be better able to understand each other when we understand that others may perceive harm where we do not
  
  - Personal experiences may be more useful tools than facts when talking to those we disagree with on moral issues
