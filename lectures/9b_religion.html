# Religion and morality
## Week 9 - Moral Psychology

# Week 9

This week, we will be discussing religious and otherwise moral convictions and values

.highlight-gray[In week 9:]

- **What qualifies as a moral conviction or a sacred value?

- How does an attitude become a moral imperative, rather than just a convention or preference?

- **Do people perceive atheists as less moral than theists?**

- **Does religion make us more moral?**

####Image generation phase

- 800 stimuli were created by adding random noise to a base face 

- The base face was a composite of a black woman, black man, white woman, and black man

- Thus the stimuli varied on the prominence of feminine and racial features

.pull-left[
#### Image generation phase
- Participants were presented with two faces at a time and asked to choose which face looks like a person who does not believe in God

- The researchers averaged the faces of the people who look like they believe in God (theists) and who do not look like they believe in God (atheists)

#### Image rating phase

- New participants rated the composite atheist face and the composite theist face on different traits

  - Religious, trustworthy, moral, competent, warm, gentle, human, hardworking, likable, happy, attractive, gender, race

**Discussion question**

Where do you expect to see differences in ratings of the atheist face vs. the theist face?

All differences are significant (95% CI not overlapping)

# The representativeness heuristic
.footnote[Kahneman (2011); Gervais (2014)]
.pull-left[
- The **representativeness heuristic** is a biased mental shortcut that occurs when one categorizes something by judging how similar 
it is to its prototype 

  - When someone is representative of a group, we assume that they must be a member 
of that group]

**Consider the following...** &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Linda is a politically active, single, liberal woman who cares deeply about social justice. Is it more probable that Linda is:

# The representativeness heuristic

.pull-left[
- If you chose b (a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement), then you made a **conjunction error**

- It is more probable that Linda is only a bank teller than it is that she is a bank teller AND a feminist

.pull-left[
- People commit **conjunction errors** when they feel that the less probable description (e.g., a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement) is representative of group membership

???

i.e., if you give a description of an immoral act, do people make a conjunction error because they think that immoral acts are representative of atheists?

# Perceptions of atheists and theists
.footnote[Gervais (2014)]

**Incest scenario**

&gt; Graeme and his sister were traveling together in France. One night they
were staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decided that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Graemeâ€™s sister was already taking
birth control pills, but Graeme used a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoyed it, but they decided not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to
each other.

**Chicken scenario**

&gt; On the way home from work, Jack decided to stop at the butcher shop to
pick up something for dinner. He decided to roast a whole chicken. He
got home, unwrapped the chicken carcass, and decided to make love to it.
He used a condom, and fully sterilized the carcass when he was
finished. He then roasted the chicken and ate it for dinner alongside a
nice glass of Chardonnay.

# Perceptions of atheists and theists

**Discussion questions**

1. Why do you think people perceive atheists so negatively?

2. Do you think atheists are more likely to commit crimes than theists? Do you think that theists are more charitable than atheists?
