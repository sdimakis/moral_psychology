# Character perception
## Week 4 - Moral Psychology

---


# Week 4
This week we will be discussing how we judge the moral character of others and ascribe blame and praise to others in moral situations

.highlight-blue[In week 4:]
- **Which traits do we automatically evaluate in strangers?**
- **How do evaluate if someone is a good person?**
- Under what conditions is someone absolved from blame for their actions?
- When is someone deserving of praise for their actions?

.left-column-med[#### Results
The researchers found that people's impressions could be categorized into two dimensions 
-  .highlight-blue[First dimension:] &lt;br&gt;trustworthy to untrustworthy

- .highlight-blue[Second dimension:] &lt;br&gt; Dominant to submissive]

???
PCA - the judgments in each component were highly correlated with each other . The first two components explained about 80% of the variance in judgment scores

He took my visiting family out for a fun evening of pizza. He then excused himself, went to a bar in South Seattle, found a young woman, and murdered her. The next day he was his charming self at a family event. One day when he was driving to Utah to go to law school, he called from Nampa, Idaho, to tell me he loved me. I learned later that he abducted a young woman that day and murdered her.

# Judging moral character

Behavior is sometimes but not always informative of whether or not someone is a good person

- We need to consider intentions, circumstances, and most importantly, their &lt;u&gt;**moral-cognitive machinery**&lt;/u&gt;
---

#  Moral-cognitive machinery
.footnote[Helzer &amp; Critcher (2018)]

We can determine if a car's *machinery* works by testing it to see if inputs cause appropriate outputs, i.e., when we do something to the car, it should react in the way that we would expect a functioning car to act 

- When you turn the key, you should hear the engine start.
- When you press on the gas pedal, the car should move forward.
- When you press on the volume button, music should play.

#  Moral-cognitive machinery
.footnote[Helzer &amp; Critcher (2018)]

Similarly, we can determine if someone's *moral-cognitive* machinery works by testing it to see if inputs cause appropriate outputs

- When a person is suffering, a person should feel compassion and a desire to help. 

- When someone cheats on their partner, they should feel guilty and compelled to stop or be honest about their actions.


---
# Moral-cognitive machinery
.footnote[Helzer &amp; Critcher (2018)]

Someone with properly functioning *moral-cognitive machinery* will...

- Attend to relevant cues

- Appropriately process the cues

- Arrive at an appropriate moral decision 

---
# Moral-cognitive machinery
.footnote[Helzer &amp; Critcher (2018)]

For example, someone with functioning moral-cognitive machinery who walks by and sees someone suffering will..

- Attend to relevant cues
  - Properly notice and identify that the person is suffering
  
- Appropriately process the cues
  - Feel sympathy for the person
  
- Arrive at an appropriate moral decision
  - Do what they can to help

---

# Moral-cognitive machinery
.footnote[Helzer &amp; Critcher (2018)]


&lt;u&gt;Person 1&lt;/u&gt; He feels sympathy for the homeless man so he gives him $10 (functioning moral-cognitive machinery with means to help)

&lt;u&gt;Person 2&lt;/u&gt; He gives $10 because he is walking with his boss who he is trying to impress (possibly broken moral-cognitive machinery)

&lt;u&gt; Person 3 &lt;/u&gt; He feels sympathy for the man but isn't carrying any money (functioning moral-cognitive machinery without means to help)

&lt;u&gt; Person 4 &lt;/u&gt; He feels giddy that there was a man suffering, calls him a loser, and walks away (definitely broken moral-cognitive machinery)


---
# Moral-cognitive machinery
.footnote[Helzer &amp; Critcher (2018)]

Someone with functioning moral-cognitive machinery will, over time, make good moral decisions (i.e., outputs), given the context (i.e., inputs)

- Good people have a *functioning moral-cognitive machinery* and bad people do not

- Since bad people have broken machinery, they will consistently do bad things

- Thus, we should care more about evaluating a person's machinery than about evaluating their specific behaviors

# Moral-cognitive machinery
.footnote[Helzer &amp; Critcher (2018)]


&gt; A runaway trolley is barreling down a set of train tracks. There is unfortunately no conductor to stop the train, which is about to run over and kill five people...

&gt; Robert is standing to the side of the track. Next to him is a lever. If he pulls the lever, it will divert the train onto an alternate track .highlight-blue[where it will kill his infant son] instead of the five. Without hesitation, Robert pulls the lever because five people is more than one person.

.left-column-med[#### Results
- People who returned the money were evaluated more positively than those who stole the money

Rate the moral character of Justin and Nate on a scale of 1 = "has entirely bad moral principles" to 7 = "has entirely good moral principles."

# Judging machinery 
.footnote[Critcher et al. (2012)]

#### Discussion
- The decision speed is assumed to reflect how easy the decision was and how confident the individual is in the decision
- When people make a decision easily, we tend to think that we are getting information about one's moral-cognitive machinery, rather than the circumstances
- This person *automatically* steals (non-functioning machinery) vs. this person *automatically* does not steal (functioning machinery)
- When the decision is slow, we can understand less about the underlying machinery because we do not know why the person is conflicted

#### Method

The participants read that a
manufacturing company was interviewing two candidates for CEO, John and
Robert

- High salary candidate requested a
salary of $2 million per year 

- Low salary candidate requested a
salary of $1 million per year plus a signing bonus (randomly assigned)
  - $40,000 cash
  - a $40,000 marble table
  - a $40,000
marble table engraved with the candidate's portrait

---
# Judging machinery
.footnote[Tannenbaum, Uhlmann, &amp; Diermeier (2011)]

.pull-right[![](images/marble table.png)]

.pull-left[#### Results
- People would rather hire the CEO asking for 1 million (+40,000) than the CEO who is asking for 2 million

- However, people consider the marble table signing bonus as indicative of *poor moral character* 

]

---

# Judging machinery
.footnote[Tannenbaum, Uhlmann, &amp; Diermeier (2011)]

.pull-right[![](images/marble table.png)]

.pull-left[#### Results
- People are willing to pay almost twice as much money to not hire someone asking for a personalized marble table

Emphasize how marble table and cash bonus are the same... the person could just buy a marble table with their cash bonus

# Judging machinery 

Let's return to the trolley problem where Robert quickly decided to be a utilitarian (decide on what is moral by the consequences of the action) and kill his infant son to save the five people on the train 

Instead of killing his son quickly and nonchalantly, you probably expected him to:

- Attend to both his infant son and the 5 people, realizing that he has a profoundly difficult decision to make
- Feel immense distress and compassion for his son and the people on the tracks
- Regretfully not be able to pull the lever (or if he does, he would show immense remorse)

# Person-act dissociations

**Person-act dissociation:** like the man willing to sacrifice his son for the greater good, moral praiseworthy actions *can* signal negative information about the character of an actor

# Person-act dissociations
.footnote[Uhlmann, Zhu, &amp; Tannenbaum (2013)]

#### Method

Researchers presented participants with a variation of the lifeboat dilemma (shipwrecked passengers deciding if they should throw an injured man overboard to keep their lifeboat from sinking)

--

Participants were randomly assigned to:
- The consequentialist (they threw the man overboard) or non-consequentialist condition (they did not throw the man overboard)
- Evaluate the act itself or the character of the decision makers

---
# Person-act dissociations
.footnote[Uhlmann, Zhu, &amp; Tannenbaum (2013)]


.pull-left[#### Results

- Individuals evaluated the consequentialist decision as more moral but the people who made the consequentialist decision as less moral]

# Person-act dissociations

#### Results

- Participants rated beating up one's girlfriend  as a morally worse *act* than beating up one's girlfriend's cat

-  Participants rated the cat-beater as having significantly worse *moral character* than the woman-beater

.dq[.smaller[What do you think harming the cat would be more informative of poor moral character?]]


---
# Person-act dissociations

.footnote[Uhlmann, Zhu, &amp; Tannenbaum (2013)]
#### Explanations

- **Empathetic suppression.** Making a consequentialist decision means that you were able to suppress your empathy (and therefore shows a non-functioning cognitive-moral machinery)

???
Psychopaths make utilitarian decisions because they wish to cause harm

--

- **Moral-motives problem.** Making the consequentialist decision could be due to wanting to do the right thing, but also, to cause harm, be selfish, etc.

--

- **Moral pragmatism**.  Acts could be judged pragmatically (not willing to sacrifice for the greater good is unpractical) while character is not

---
# Summary

- We infer moral traits about others automatically, from as little as their appearance 
- Behavior can be uninformative if we are trying to understand someone's moral character
  - Good people do bad things and bad people do good things
  - Instead, we evaluate one's moral machinery - if they react as they should to moral situations
- Sometimes we evaluate people negatively for doing actions that we consider admirable, and positively for doing actions that we consider immoral (called a person-act dissociation)
